Inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) are promising
anticancer drugs, particularly for the treatment of tumors deficient
in the DNA damage response (DDR). However, it is challenging to
design effective therapeutic strategies for use of these compounds
against cancers without DDR deficiencies. In this context, combination
therapies in which PARP inhibitors are used alongside DDR
inhibitors have elicited a great deal of interest. Curcumin, a component
of turmeric (Curcuma longa), has been tested in clinical
studies for its chemosensitizing potential; however, the mechanisms
of chemosensitization by curcumin have not been fully elucidated.
This study demonstrates that curcumin suppresses three major
DDR pathways: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), homologous
recombination (HR) and the DNA damage checkpoint. Curcumin
suppresses the histone acetylation at DNA double-strand break
(DSB) sites by inhibiting histone acetyltransferase activity, thereby
reducing recruitment of the key NHEJ factor KU70/KU80 to DSB
sites. Curcumin also suppresses HR by reducing expression of the
BRCA1 gene, which regulates HR, by impairing histone acetylation
at the BRCA1 promoter. Curcumin also inhibits ataxia telangiectasia
and Rad3-related protein (ATR) kinase (IC50 in vitro = 493nM),
resulting in impaired activation of ATR-CHK1 signaling, which is
necessary for HR and the DNA damage checkpoint pathway. Thus,
curcumin suppresses three DDR pathways by inhibiting histone
acetyltransferases and ATR. Concordantly, curcumin sensitizes
cancer cells to PARP inhibitors by enhancing apoptosis and mitotic
catastrophe via inhibition of both the DNA damage checkpoint and
DSB repair. Our results indicate that curcumin is a promising sensitizer
for PARP inhibitor-based therapy.

Introduction

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are a promising new
class of anticancer drugs that inhibit the enzymatic activity of PARP1
protein, which is involved in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks
(SSBs) (1). Inhibition of PARP1 impairs SSB repair and increases the
number of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (1). Cancer cells that

lack intact BRCA1 or BRCA2 protein, exemplified by hereditary breast
and ovarian cancers, are deficient in the DNA damage response (DDR)
(2–5). Several clinical trials have demonstrated that PARP inhibitors
are highly effective at killing such cancers (6–10). Inhibition of PARP
activity is also detrimental to cancer cells whose DDR activities are
deficient due to RNAi-mediated ablation of DDR genes other than
BRCA1/2 (5,11). However, most human cancers contain intact DDR
genes and retain DDR activity. Therefore, it will be challenging, but
is nonetheless essential, to establish effective therapeutic methods for
using PARP inhibitors against the majority of cancers, which lack DDR
deficiencies. In such efforts, drugs that inhibit protein(s) required for
DDR pathways will be used to potentiate the effect of PARP inhibitors.
Three DDR pathways, including homologous recombination (HR),
non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and the DNA damage checkpoint,
play important roles in allowing cancer cells to survive genotoxic
events caused by treatment with PARP inhibitors. Two of these
pathways are major systems devoted to the repair of DSBs: NHEJ
joins broken DNA ends without requiring extensive sequence homology,
whereas HR uses long stretches of homologous sequence (12–
14). The third pathway is the DNA damage checkpoint, which arrests
the cell cycle in the presence of DNA damage (15).
The fundamental steps of NHEJ, synapsis and ligation,
employ KU80/DNA-PKCS and LIG4-XRCC4-XLF, respectively
(11,12,14,16–20). However, histone modification and chromatin
remodeling are also required to relax chromatin and permit recruitment
of NHEJ factors (21,22). Histone acetylation at DSB sites by the
histone acetyltransferases (HATs) CBP, p300 and GCN5 is a critical
step that allows accumulation of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling
complex, which opens chromatin structure and thereby grants access
to NHEJ factors (22,23).
The HR pathway, on the other hand, restores the genomic sequence
at a DSB by utilizing the sister chromatid as a template for repair
(24). In HR, DSBs are first recognized by the MRE11-RAD50-
NBS1 (MRN) complex, which is then activated by CtIP and BRCA1
(25,26). Next, the DNA ends are resected by the MRN complex to
allow accumulation of replication protein A (RPA) (RPA70/RPA32/
RPA16) (27). Assembly of RAD51 on RPA-coated single-stranded
DNA (RPA-ssDNA) leads to HR (28). RPA-ssDNA activates ataxia
telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR), leading to phosphorylation
of CHK1 kinase, which in turn phosphorylates RAD51 and
thereby promotes RAD51 recruitment to damaged sites. Thus, ATRCHK1
signaling positively regulates the HR pathway (29,30).
DSBs also cause the activation of the ATR-CHK1 and ATM-CHK2
DNA damage checkpoint pathways, which arrest the cell cycle to
allow sufficient time for DNA repair to take place (31,32). Inhibition
of the DNA damage checkpoint abrogates cell cycle arrest, leading
to mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis while mostly sparing non-cancerous
cells. This effect appears to be stronger in some cancer cells
than in non-cancer cells, presumably because the more sensitive cancer
cells contain unspecified abnormalities in DDR pathways (33–36).
Effective sensitization to PARP inhibitor-based therapy could
be achieved by inhibiting any of these three DDR pathways (37).
To this end, one could use PARP inhibitors in combination with
compounds that effectively inhibit DDR and ideally exert minimal
toxicity in the human body. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is a yellow
pigment contained in Indian saffron (Curcuma longa; turmeric) and
has been traditionally used as a foodstuff, cosmetic and medicine.
In addition, curcumin can inhibit a variety of enzymes, including
HATs (35). Because it is non-toxic even at high doses, curcumin has
been intensively tested in both preclinical and clinical trials for its
chemopreventive potential in a variety of diseases, including cancer
(35). In addition, recent clinical studies indicate that curcumin is
potentially useful as a sensitizer in gemcitabine chemotherapy against

Curcumin suppresses DSB repair and DNA damage checkpoint

advanced pancreatic cancers (38,39). One candidate mechanism for
the chemosensitizing effect of curcumin in cancer cells is suppression
of the antiapoptotic nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) pathway through
inhibition of IKKβ, an activator of NF-κB (40,41). IKKβ is involved
in the repair of ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DSBs, and several
other targets of curcumin, including AKT1 (37) and CBP/p300 (42),
are also involved in the DDR. AKT1 interacts with and activates a
NHEJ key factor, DNA-PKCS (43–45). We recently showed that CBP
and p300 promote NHEJ, HR and the DNA damage checkpoint via
histone acetylation at DSB sites and the promoter regions of genes
encoding two key HR factors, BRCA1 and RAD51 (22,46). Thus,
because it could potentially suppress multiple DDRs in cancer cells,
curcumin is a strong candidate for an agent that could sensitize cancer
cells to PARP inhibitors; however, this possibility has not yet been
investigated.
Here, we show that curcumin inhibits NHEJ and HR by suppressing
histone acetylation at DSB sites, as well as by suppressing
transcription of the BRCA1 gene through histone acetylation at its
promoter region, as predicted from its inhibition of CBP and p300. In
addition, we report a novel activity for curcumin, inhibition of ATR
kinase, which results in impaired activation of ATR-CHK1 signaling.
Because curcumin can simultaneously suppress two major DSB
repair pathways, NHEJ and HR, as well as the ATR-CHK1 DNA damage
checkpoint pathway, it holds promise as a sensitizer for PARP
inhibitor-based cancer therapy.

Materials and methods

Materials
HeLa (cervical cancer), U2OS (osteosarcoma), HT1080 (fibrosarcoma) and
HCT116 (colorectal cancer) cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. H1299 (nonsmall-cell
lung carcinoma) cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum. These cell lines were used as representatives
of cancers that do not have DDR deficiency as a result of BRCA1/2 mutations.
The chemical agents used in this study were as follows: curcumin
(Sigma: ≥94% curcuminoid content; Sabinsa: ≥95% curcuminoid content)
and olaparib (Selleck). Curcumin from Sabinsa was used only for experiments
to address effects on phosphorylation on checkpoint-related proteins
(Figure 4A).
Irradiation
Irradiation was performed using a 60Co γ-ray source (Atomic Energy of
Canada, Ontario, Canada) at a dose rate of 9.1 Gy/min.
Immunofluorescence microscopy
Cells were grown on glass cover slips, fixed with 2% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15min at room temperature
and then permeabilized with 0.3% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 for 15min at
room temperature. After fixation, cells were washed three times with PBS
and then blocked with blocking buffer (BB: 1% bovine serum albumin,
0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 10min. Cells were incubated with primary
antibody (diluted in BB) for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS and
then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated
goat anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor
568-conjugated goat anti-mouse or Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit
secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) diluted in BB. Cells were then
washed three times with PBS and counter-stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(0.4 μg/ml in PBS) to visualize DNA. The cover slips were mounted
onto glass slides using Prolong Gold mounting agent (Invitrogen). Confocal
images were taken using an inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with
a ×100 oil lens. Images were acquired using the ZEN Software 2008 (Carl
Zeiss). All immunofluorescence experiments were repeated at least twice, and
representative images are shown. The percentage of foci-positive cells was
determined from >100 cells per sample, and each of these experiments was
performed in triplicate.
In vitro kinase assays
The ATR kinase assays were performed essentially as described previously
(47), with the following modifications. To analyze the inhibitory effect of
curcumin, the ATR-ATRIP (ATR interacting protein) complex was purified
using a two-step protocol. HEK 293E cells were transfected with FLAGATR-
and His-ATRIP-expressing plasmids, and the ATR-ATRIP complex was

purified using Ni-beads followed by elution with imidazole. Proteins eluted
from the Ni-beads were subsequently incubated with anti-FLAG M2 beads,
and the ATR-ATRIP complex was eluted with 200 μg/ml 3 × FLAG peptide.
The kinase reactions were performed using purified ATR-ATRIP complex,
GST-Rad17 and 10 μCi [γ32P]ATP
in the presence or absence of curcumin.
The concentration of curcumin that achieved 50% inhibition of the enzyme
(IC50) was derived from log approximation plots. Enzyme activity was plotted
against curcumin concentration. Data represent the means ± SD of three
independent experiments.
DNA damage checkpoint analysis
Cells were exposed to 2 Gy IR from a 60Co source after exposure to the indicated
agents for 1 h. Cells were harvested 1 h after IR exposure, washed twice
with ice-cold PBS, fixed, permeabilized with 70% ethanol and stored at −20°C
for at least 2 h. Fixed cells were blocked with BB (0.5% bovine serum albumin
in PBS) for 10min at room temperature. Cells were then stained for 1 h at room
temperature with an anti-phospho-histone H3 (Ser10) antibody diluted 1:25 in
BB. Washes were carried out three times in PBS. For secondary staining, cells
were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with fluorescein-isothiocyanateconjugated
donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch),
diluted 1:100 in BB. After secondary antibody staining, cells were washed
three times, incubated with 5  μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) and 200  μg/ml
RNase I in PBS and analyzed using a Guava flow cytometer. The resulting data
were analyzed using the GuavaSoft 2.2 software.
Survival assays
For clonogenic assays, cells were trypsinized, counted and plated in sixwell
dishes (500–1000 cells/dish). Cells were incubated for 6h before drug
treatment. Following a 14  day recovery and growth period, colonies were
fixed in a 50% (vol/vol) methanol/0.01% (wt/vol) crystal violet solution for
5min. Survival points were assayed in triplicate, and data are shown as the
means ± SD. Cell viability was determined by assessing cellular adenosine
triphosphate levels using a CellTiter-Glo kit (Promega Corporation, Madison,
WI).
Statistical analysis
Drug-treatment experiments were performed in triplicate. Data are shown as
the means ± SD. Differences between drug-treated and untreated cells were
evaluated by Student’s t-test, and statistical differences are indicated by
asterisks (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; and ****P < 0.0001).

Results

Curcumin suppresses NHEJ by suppressing histone acetylation at
DSB sites
Curcumin acts as a chemo- and radiosensitizer (39), suggesting that
it suppresses DSB repair; however, the underlying mechanisms are
unknown. We first examined the effects of curcumin on the repair
of IR-induced DSBs using a neutral comet assay, which specifically
detects DSBs. Curcumin impaired the repair of IR-induced DSBs in
HeLa cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 1A and B).
Next, we investigated whether NHEJ can be suppressed by curcumin
(Figure  1C) using an NHEJ assay we developed previously (22).
Treatment of H1299dA3-1 cells with either curcumin or NU7026,
an inhibitor of the key NHEJ factor DNA-PKCS, led to a reduction
in the proportion of enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP)-
positive cells (Figure 1D), indicating that curcumin has the ability to
suppress NHEJ.
Recently, we revealed that CBP and p300, two HATs targeted by
curcumin (48), acetylate histones near DSB sites and are required
for efficient DSB repair (22). In light of this finding, we investigated
the impact of curcumin treatment on histone acetylation induced
by I-SceI-mediated DSBs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
assays revealed that the acetylation levels of histone H3 K18 near
the I-SceI site decreased upon treatment with curcumin (Figure 1E).
In addition, curcumin treatment led to a reduction in recruitment
of the key NHEJ factors KU70 and KU80 to DSB sites induced by
I-SceI or laser microirradiation (Figure 1F–H). Consistent with this,
IR-induced phosphorylation of DNA-PKCS, which is dependent on
KU70/KU80 binding at DSB ends, was suppressed by treatment with
curcumin (Figure 1I), as well as by knockdown of CBP or p300 (data

Curcumin suppresses DSB repair and DNA damage checkpoint

not shown). Neither curcumin treatment nor small interfering RNA
(siRNA)-mediated knockdown of CBP and p300 affected the expression
level of core NHEJ factors (data not shown) (22). These observations
implied that curcumin suppresses NHEJ by inhibiting the HAT
activities of CBP and p300.
Treatment with specific inhibitors of AKT, a target of curcumin
that may be involved in NHEJ (44,45,49), also led to a reduction
in the proportion of enhanced GFP-positive cells (Supplementary
Figure S1A, available at Carcinogenesis Online). A  similar reduction
was observed when AKT1 was knocked down using siRNA
(Supplementary Figure S1B and C, available at Carcinogenesis
Online). However, treatment of curcumin at a concentration that suppresses
NHEJ in vivo did not inhibit phosphorylation of AKT (i.e.
AKT activation) in response to IR, although treatment with inhibitors
of DNA-PKCS or AKT did reduce AKT activation (Supplementary
Figure S1D, available at Carcinogenesis Online). Another target of
curcumin, IKKβ, is also involved in the repair of IR-induced DNA
damage. Treating cells with the specific IKKβ inhibitor BMS-345541
(IKKi III), at or above the concentration that reduces cell growth by
50% (IG50; Supplementary Figure S1E, available at Carcinogenesis
Online), did not significantly suppress NHEJ activity (Supplementary
Figure S1A, available at Carcinogenesis Online). Together, these
results strongly suggest that suppression of NHEJ by curcumin
results from inhibition of CBP and p300.

Curcumin suppresses HR by transcriptional suppression of BRCA1
We next investigated the impact of curcumin treatment on HR
of DSBs using an in vivo GFP-based chromosomal assay. In the
DR-GFP assay, a DSB is generated by expression of the I-SceI
endonuclease, whose recognition site is integrated in the GFP gene
such that digestion disrupts the gene and HR restores the intact GFP
gene (Figure 2A) (50). Curcumin treatment reduced the proportion
of GFP-positive cells, as did treatment with KU55933, a specific
inhibitor of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), which is required
for the activation of several HR-related factors (42,51) (Figure 2B).
The proportion of repaired products, but not the proportion of cut
products, was reduced by treatment with curcumin (Figure 2C and D;
Supplementary Figure S2, available at Carcinogenesis Online), indicating
that curcumin inhibits HR activity but neither DSB generation
nor GFP transcription.
We recently revealed that double knockdown of CBP and p300
causes downregulation of BRCA1 expression by suppressing histone
acetylation and recruitment of the E2F1 transcription factor to the
BRCA1 promoter region (46). BRCA1 contributes to DNA end resection
at DSBs as a component of the BRCA1-CtIP-MRN complex.
This complex promotes RPA phosphorylation, leading to the binding
of phosphorylated RPA and RAD51 to ssDNA and ultimately to
formation of RAD51/RPA foci that undergo HR (25,26). Treatment
with curcumin for 24 h led to the downregulation of BRCA1 protein
and mRNA levels in HeLa and H1299 cells (Figure  2E and
F). As in the case of siRNA-mediated CBP/p300 knockdown (46),

curcumin treatment reduced the acetylation levels of histone H3 and
the localization of E2F1 at the BRCA1 promoter region (Figure 2G;
Supplementary Figure S3, available at Carcinogenesis Online).
BRCA1 transcription levels change during the cell cycle: they are low
in G0/G1 phase and high in the S and G2 phases (23,52). However,
curcumin treatment increased the population of cells in S and G2/M
but not in G1 (Supplementary Figure S4, available at Carcinogenesis
Online). Therefore, the decrease in BRCA1 expression was not due to
cell cycle changes but was instead likely to be due to the suppression
of histone acetylation at the BRCA1 promoter region.
BRCA1 regulates the recruitment of RPA to DSB sites by promoting
resection of DNA ends (25,53). We recently showed that siRNAmediated
knockdown of CBP or p300, which causes a reduction in
BRCA1 expression, suppresses the recruitment of RPA to DSB sites
(46). Consistent with this, curcumin treatment for 24 h also impaired
the neocarzinostatin (NCS)-induced phosphorylation of RPA32 in
both HeLa and H1299 cells (Figure 2H). Together, these data indicate
that curcumin suppresses HR by downregulating the transcription of
BRCA1.

Curcumin suppresses HR and the DNA damage checkpoint by
inhibiting ATR kinase
In contrast to the long-term (24 h) treatment described above, short-term
(1 h) treatment with curcumin did not affect the NCS-induced phosphorylation
of RPA32 (Figure 3A), the proportion of cells positive for
IR- or camptothecin (CPT)-induced RPA32/53BP1 foci (Figure 3B–D,
Supplementary Figure S5A and B, available at Carcinogenesis Online)
or the formation of IR-induced BRCA1 foci (Supplementary Figure S5C,
available at Carcinogenesis Online). On the other hand, the proportion
of cells containing IR-induced RAD51 foci was considerably reduced
by short-term treatment with curcumin (Figure  4E; Supplementary
Figure S5D, available at Carcinogenesis Online). These results led us to
hypothesize that curcumin inhibits targets other than CBP/p300 HATs.
CPT and hydroxyurea (HU) cause DSBs during DNA replication in S
phase by inducing collapse of replication forks, and the resulting DSBs
undergo HR (54). Consistent with this, >90% of CPT- or HU-treated
cells containing pan-nuclear γH2AX foci also contained RAD51 foci;
however, the proportion of such cells significantly decreased following
treatment with curcumin (Figure 3F; Supplementary Figure S5E, available
at Carcinogenesis Online). Curcumin also decreased the elevation
in the amount of RAD51, but not of RPA32 and RPA70, in the chromatin-enriched
fraction following IR treatment (Figure 3G). These results
suggest that curcumin has the additional ability to suppress RAD51
assembly, irrespective of DNA end resection.
RAD51 assembly on damaged chromatin requires ATR-CHK1
signaling in response to the formation of RPA-coated ssDNA: ATR
kinase activates CHK1 by phosphorylating CHK1 at Ser345, and activated
CHK1 enhances RAD51 assembly and the HR reaction (29).
Therefore, we next investigated whether curcumin suppresses CHK1
phosphorylation induced by DNA damage. IR-induced CHK1 phosphorylation
was impaired by treatment with curcumin (Figure 4A),

whereas CHK2 phosphorylation, reflecting ATM-CHK2 signaling,
was not. A similar result was observed upon siRNA-mediated knockdown
of ATR but not upon inhibition of ATM (Figure  4B and C).
Impairment of CHK1 phosphorylation by curcumin was also observed
following CPT or NCS treatment of HeLa, H1299, and HT1080 cells
(Figure 4D). These results led us to hypothesize that curcumin inhibits
the kinase activity of ATR.

To test this idea, we performed an in vitro ATR kinase assay
using an ATR-ATRIP complex constituted from recombinant proteins
(47). Phosphorylation of the substrate protein RAD17 was
suppressed by curcumin in a dose-dependent manner, with an
IC50 of 493 nM (Figure 4E; Supplementary Figure S6, available at
Carcinogenesis Online). To confirm further the effects of ATR inhibition
by curcumin in vivo, we monitored DNA damage-induced

Curcumin suppresses DSB repair and DNA damage checkpoint

autophosphorylation of the Thr1989 residue of ATR, which represents
the active state of the ATR protein (47). Consistent with the
results of the in vitro kinase assay, phosphorylation of Thr1989
in response to IR, HU and CPT was suppressed by curcumin in
vivo (Figure 4F). HU induces ATR-dependent phosphorylation of
serine residues 4 and 8 within the RPA protein (55–57). Treatment
with curcumin reduced the proportion of HU-treated cells with

phosphorylated RPA32 foci among cells that contained pannuclear
RPA32 foci (Figure 4G; Supplementary Figure S7, available
at Carcinogenesis Online). Consistent with this, curcumin
treatment also reduced the fraction of phosphorylated RPA32
induced by HU (Figure 4H). These results demonstrate that, as we
hypothesized, curcumin suppresses HR by inhibiting the kinase
activity of ATR.

Curcumin suppresses DSB repair and DNA damage checkpoint

ATR-CHK1 signaling regulates not only HR but also the DNA
damage checkpoint (31). Therefore, we next investigated whether
curcumin also abrogates the DNA damage checkpoint. IR treatment
reduced the proportion of cells containing phosphorylated histone
H3 (Ser10), a mitotic marker, indicating that irradiated cells underwent
cell cycle arrest at G2 via activation of the G2/M DNA damage
checkpoint. This reduction in H3-Ser10 phosphorylation was
prevented by curcumin treatment (Figure  4I). Thus, by inhibiting
ATR, curcumin suppresses not only HR but also the DNA damage
checkpoint.
Curcumin inhibits the activity of IKKβ, an activator of the NF-κB
pathway, which regulates several cellular responses against DNA
damage. Therefore, we investigated whether the inhibition of this
pathway might also contribute to the suppression of HR and the DNA
damage checkpoint. Inhibition of IKKβ by treatment with a specific
inhibitor at the IC50 did not affect activation of the G2/M DNA damage
checkpoint or IR-induced formation of RAD51 foci (Supplementary
Figure S1F and G, available at Carcinogenesis Online). However, this
inhibitor significantly suppressed HR activity in the DR-GFP assay
(Supplementary Figure S1H, available at Carcinogenesis Online),
suggesting that the IKK-mediated NF-κB pathway enhances steps
of HR downstream of RAD51. These results further support the idea
that curcumin inhibits CBP/p300-mediated histone acetylation at
DSB sites and the BRCA1 promoter region, as well as ATR-dependent
CHK1 activation, resulting in suppression of HR and the DNA damage
checkpoint response.

Curcumin sensitizes cancer cells to PARP inhibitors
Deficiencies in HR and the DNA damage checkpoint make cancer
cells sensitive to PARP inhibitors (58). Therefore, we predicted that
curcumin might act as a sensitizer for cancer cell death induced by
PARP inhibition. Indeed, treatment with curcumin sensitized HeLa
cells to a PARP inhibitor, olaparib, which has been extensively tested
in clinical trials (58) (Figure 5A). The sensitization was also observed
for another PARP inhibitor, 4-amino-1,8-naphthalimide (Figure 5A).
We also observed sensitization to one of these PARP inhibitors in
three other cancer cell lines (Figure 5B). HeLa cells were also sensitized
to the DSB-inducing agents CPT and HU (Figure 5C). These
results strongly suggest that by suppressing responses against DSBs,
curcumin can sensitize a variety of cancer cells with intact BRCA1/2-
mediated DDRs to PARP inhibitors.
We next investigated the mechanism underlying curcumininduced
sensitization to PARP inhibitors. Curcumin suppressed
PARP inhibitor-induced CHK1 activation without affecting the activation
of the ATM-CHK2 pathway (Figure 5D). Olaparib increases
the proportion of γH2AX-positive cells in a concentration-dependent
manner; these increases were more evident following combined
treatment with curcumin (Figure  5E; Supplementary Figure S8A,
available at Carcinogenesis Online). Cell cycle analysis revealed
that the proportion of cells in the G2/M phase was higher in cells cotreated
with olaparib and curcumin than in cells treated with either
drug alone (Supplementary Figure S8B, available at Carcinogenesis
Online). In addition, combination treatment also increased the proportions
of sub-G1 and >4N cells, which represent cells undergoing
death due to apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe, respectively
(Supplementary Figure S8B, available at Carcinogenesis Online).
Consistent with this, flow cytometry analysis of Annexin V/

PI-stained cells confirmed that combined treatment with olaparib
and curcumin increased the proportion of apoptotic cells (Figure 5F;
Supplementary Figure S8C, available at Carcinogenesis Online). In
addition, the proportion of morphologically abnormal micronucleated
cells, representing cells undergoing mitotic catastrophe, also
increased upon combined treatment (Figure  5G; Supplementary
Figure S8D, available at Carcinogenesis Online). These results indicate
that curcumin abrogates both DNA repair and the DNA damage
checkpoint in response to DSBs generated by PARP inhibition,
resulting in accumulation of DSBs and cell death via apoptosis and
mitotic catastrophe.

Discussion

The results of this study demonstrate that curcumin suppresses three
major DDRs against genotoxic events mediated by PARP inhibition:
NHEJ, HR and the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint (Figure 6). This
suppression results from the inhibition of CBP/p300 HATs and ATR
kinase. The impact of curcumin on NHEJ is mediated by the suppression
of histone acetylation at DSB sites, which prevents accumulation
of NHEJ proteins, e.g. KU70/KU80, that are responsible
for DNA synapsis. This is consistent with the outcome of CBP/p300
depletion (22). In addition, it is also possible that NHEJ suppression
by curcumin is caused by inhibition of AKT1 kinase, involved
in the activation of DNA-PKCS along with KU70/KU80 (43,45), or
by inhibition of IKKβ, an activator of NF-κB, which is involved in
DDRs in a variety of ways (44). However, curcumin suppressed the
IR-induced phosphorylation of DNA-PKCS, but not AKT, suggesting
that NHEJ suppression by curcumin is mainly due to inhibition
of KU70/KU80 accumulation, which is essential for DNA-PKCS
activation. In addition, inhibition of IKKβ by a specific inhibitor,
BMS-345541, did not suppress NHEJ activity. These results indicate
that the suppression of the activities of the histone acetyltransferases
CBP and p300 is a major mechanism of NHEJ suppression
by curcumin.
As in the case of NHEJ, the impact of curcumin on HR was also
mediated by the suppression of histone acetylation at DSB sites. In
addition, suppression of histone acetylation at the promoter region
of the BRCA1 gene was also likely to be responsible: BRCA1 contributes
to DNA end resection at DSBs by forming the BRCA1-
CtIP-MRN complex, which promotes binding of RPA and RAD51
to ssDNA, followed by formation of RAD51/RPA foci that undergo
HR. These phenomena were suppressed by curcumin treatment. As
noted above, we recently showed that the knockdown of CBP/p300
leads to the transcriptional repression of the BRCA1 gene, associated
with decreases in both histone acetylation and accumulation of E2F1
transcription factor at the promoter region. Therefore, suppression of
BRCA1 expression by curcumin is likely to be caused by inhibition
of CBP/p300 HAT activities. In this study, inhibition of IKKβ by a
specific inhibitor, BMS-345541, did not suppress NHEJ or the DNA
damage checkpoint, but it did suppress HR in the DR-GFP assay
without affecting RAD51 assembly. Therefore, IKKβ inhibition by
curcumin might represent an additional mechanism of HR suppression,
i.e. via inhibition of the steps of HR downstream of RAD51
assembly. Thus, inhibition of CBP/p300-mediated histone acetylation
at DSB sites and the BRCA1 promoter region is a major mechanism
for the suppression of HR by curcumin.

ATR and ATR-pT1989 were analyzed using the indicated antibodies. (G) Suppression of HU-induced formation of phosphorylated RPA32 foci by curcumin.
HeLa cells were treated with DMSO (NT) or 15 µM curcumin (Cur). One hour after treatment, the cells were treated with 5mM HU for 3 h. Percentages are
shown of cells containing foci of pan-nuclear RPA32, which were positive for RPA phosphorylated at Ser4/Ser8. Data represent the mean ± SD. The percentage
of foci-positive cells was determined from >100 cells per sample, and each experiment was performed in triplicate. (H) Reduction in HU-induced phosphorylated
RPA32 protein levels after treatment with curcumin. HeLa cells pretreated with DMSO (–) or 15 µM curcumin (+) for 1 h were treated with 0 (–) or 5mM
HU (+) and then subjected to immunoblotting 3 h later. The levels of RPA32 and RPA32 phosphorylated at Ser4/Ser8 were analyzed using the indicated
antibodies. (I) Suppression of the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint by curcumin. HeLa cells were treated with DMSO, curcumin (Cur 10 or 15 μM) or the ATM
inhibitor KU55933 (ATMi 10 or 15 μM) for 1 h. The cells were then irradiated with 3 Gy (IR) or not irradiated (NT) and then 1 h later were stained with PI and
antibodies against phospho-histone H3. The percentage of mitotic cells (mitotic index) was determined by flow cytometry. Data represent the means ± SD. Each
experiment was performed in triplicate. Asterisks indicate a significant difference between curcumin-treated and untreated cells, as determined by Student’s t-test
(**P < 0.01).

Curcumin suppresses DSB repair and DNA damage checkpoint

ATR-CHK1 signaling is critical to both HR and the DNA damage
checkpoint and is essential for survival following treatment with
a PARP inhibitor (31,59). Our results here reveal a novel activity of
curcumin, i.e. inhibition of the kinase activity of ATR, which regulates
HR and the DNA damage checkpoint. Curcumin treatment suppressed
ATR-CHK1 but not ATM-CHK2 signaling in response to treatments
with PARP inhibitors and other DNA-damaging agents such as CPT
and NCS. Previously, in contrast to our results, another group reported
that curcumin treatment activates CHK1 (60,61). In those studies, the
authors observed that CHK1 and ATM, but neither CHK2 nor ATR,
were phosphorylated following treatment with curcumin for 24–48 h
and that CHK1 phosphorylation was dependent on ATM activity. By
contrast, under our experimental conditions, CHK1 phosphorylation
and γH2AX were not induced even after a 24 h treatment, and NCSinduced
CHK1 phosphorylation was also suppressed by a 24 h curcumin
treatment (Supplementary Figure S9, available at Carcinogenesis
Online). Therefore, we speculate that curcumin does indeed inhibit
ATR-dependent CHK1 phosphorylation, but that long-term exposure
of curcumin causes ATM activation by abrogating multiple DDR pathways
following ATM-dependent CHK1 phosphorylation.

PARP inhibitors are promising drugs for the treatment of
BRCA1/BRCA2-associated cancers; however, to utilize PARP
inhibitors in clinical settings, efficient therapeutic strategies are
required, particularly for cancers in which BRCA1 and BRCA2
mutations rarely occur (62). Sensitization to PARP inhibitors is
predicted to occur as a result of inhibition of DDRs including
NHEJ, HR and the DNA damage checkpoint (37). The results
of this study indicate that curcumin suppresses all three of these
DDRs by inhibition of CBP/p300 HATs and ATR kinase and
thereby confers sensitivity to PARP inhibitors on cancer cells that
retain BRCA1/2-mediated DDRs.
Other effects of curcumin are also potentially related to sensitization.
PARP1 is an activator of E2F1 and CBP/p300 (63), and transcription
of the gene encoding the ATR activator Claspin, as well as
expression of CHK1 and RAD51, is positively regulated by E2F1
(64,65). Therefore, curcumin treatment might lead to repression of not
only BRCA1 but also other E2F1 target genes involved in DDR pathways.
Furthermore, in light of our finding that curcumin enhances the
accumulation of DSBs, apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe induced by
PARP inhibitors, curcumin-mediated inhibition of the antiapoptotic

Fig. 6. Model: How curcumin inhibits three major DNA damage responses. (A) Activation of DDRs by the PARP inhibitor olaparib. (B) Suppression of DDRs
activated by olaparib in combination with curcumin. The PARP inhibitor suppresses repair of DNA SSBs. Unrepaired SSBs are converted to DNA DSBs by
collapse of stalled replication forks during DNA replication. In the NHEJ pathway, curcumin inhibits CBP and p300, reducing histone acetylation at DSB
sites, causing KU70/80 to fail to accumulate at DSBs and ultimately leading to suppression of NHEJ. Curcumin suppresses HR through reduction of CBP/
p300-mediated histone acetylation at DSBs and at the BRCA1 promoter, resulting in reduced BRCA1 expression. Curcumin also inhibits ATR kinase, leading to
suppression of CHK1-dependent RAD51 activation and the DNA damage checkpoint pathway. Curcumin-mediated suppression of DSB repair pathways and the
DNA damage checkpoint results in the accumulation of DSBs and induction of cell death by apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe.

were pretreated with DMSO or 15 μM curcumin for 1 h; treated with DMSO, 10 μM olaparib, 15 μM curcumin or a combination of curcumin and olaparib and
then subjected to immunoblotting 6 h later. (E) Accumulation of olaparib-induced DSBs was increased by curcumin treatment. HeLa cells were treated with

triplicate experiments. (F) Apoptosis in cells treated with curcumin and olaparib. HeLa cells were treated with DMSO (NT) or olaparib (5 or 10 μM) in the
presence (+) or absence (−) of 10 μM curcumin for 96 h and then stained with Annexin V (conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate) and PI. The percentage of
Annexin V-positive cells (early and late apoptotic cells) is represented as the mean ± SD of triplicate experiments. (G) Mitotic catastrophe in curcumin/olaparibtreated

functions of both the NF-κB pathway and the ATR-CHK1 cell-cycle
checkpoint pathway might also play significant roles. These points
should be further investigated to comprehensively elucidate the
effects of curcumin on DDRs.
Recently, specific inhibitors against ATR kinase have been identified,
and their utility in cancer therapy will be tested in future studies
(66,67); in particular, their safety and tolerability in humans are
unknown and must be investigated. On the other hand, curcumin
has been examined in several clinical studies for its anticancer and
chemosensitizing activities (39), and its low toxicity in humans has
been amply demonstrated (6–8,38). Considering that it suppresses not
only ATR but also CBP/p300 HATs, which positively regulates two
major DSB repair pathways, and also possibly enhances apoptosis
and mitotic catastrophe, curcumin is a strong candidate for a drug
that could be used to increase the efficacy of PARP inhibitor-based
therapies.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that curcumin suppresses
multiple DDRs, including NHEJ, HR and the G2/M DNA damage
checkpoint, by inhibiting CBP/p300 HATs and ATR kinase. These
DDRs are critical for recovery from DSBs generated by the actions
of PARP inhibitors. NHEJ and HR are the two major DSB repair
pathways involving BRCA1/2. ATR-CHK1 signaling is critical for
the induction of cell death via apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe
in response to persistent DSBs. Consistent with this, curcumin
enhanced the sensitivity to PARP inhibitors of DDR-proficient
cancer cells by inducing both apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe,
indicating its potential utility as a sensitizer for PARP inhibitorbased
cancer therapy. Notably, higher concentrations of curcumin
led to greater sensitization to DNA-damaging agents and greater
suppression of DDRs. Therefore, delivery of curcumin to tumor
cells at high concentrations might be necessary to achieve optimal
sensitization. Ongoing studies using animal models in our laboratory
will determine the effects of sensitization to PARP inhibitors
in vivo.
