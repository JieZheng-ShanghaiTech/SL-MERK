Abstract
Purpose: Prostate cancer development is often associated with deletion or silencing of tumor suppressor
phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)–Akt
pathway, leading to resistance to various therapies in both the preclinical and clinical setting. Therefore, the
PI3K–Akt pathway plays a central role in various cellular processes promoting survival signaling that can
contribute to the malignant phenotype, and, consequently, is an attractive pharmacologic target. However,
as single agents, the efficacy of AKT inhibitors may be limited by resistance mechanisms that result in
minimal cell death in tumor cells.
Experimental Design: We investigated the effects of the Akt inhibitor AZD5363 on cell proliferation, cell
cycle, apoptosis, and Akt downstream pathway proteins. Survival mechanisms induced by AZD5363 were
investigated. We then examined the impacts of inhibition of autophagy in combination with AZD5363 on
cell proliferation and apoptosis. Furthermore, the anticancer activity of combination treatment of the
lysosomotropic inhibitor of autophagy (chloroquine) with the Akt inhibitor AZD5363 was evaluated in
PC-3 prostate cancer xenografts.
Results: Here, we show that the Akt inhibitor AZD5363 affected the Akt downstream pathway by
reducing p-mTOR, p-P70S6K, and p-S6K. While AZD5363 monotherapy induced G2 growth arrest and
autophagy, it failed to induce significant apoptosis in PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines. Blocking
autophagy using pharmacologic inhibitors (3-methyladenine, chloroquine, and bafilomycin A) or genetic
inhibitors (siRNA targeting Atg3 and Atg7) enhanced cell death induced by Akt inhibitor AZD5363 in these
tumor prostate cell lines. Importantly, the combination of AZD5363 with chloroquine significantly reduced
tumor volume by 84.9% compared with the control group and by 77.5% compared with either drug alone in
PC3 xenografts.
Conclusion: Taken together, these data show that the Akt inhibitor AZD5363 synergizes with the
lysosomotropic inhibitor of autophagy chloroquine to induce apoptosis and delay tumor progression in
prostate cancer models that are resistant to monotherapy AZD5363, providing a new therapeutic approach
potentially translatable to patients. Clin Cancer Res; 19(4); 833–44. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and the
third most common cause of cancer-related mortality in

men in the United States (1). Androgen ablation remains
the standard effective therapy for patients with advanced
prostate cancer, inhibiting proliferation and inducing
apoptosis in tumor cells (2). Unfortunately, after shortterm
remissions, surviving tumor cells recur with castrateresistant
prostate cancer (CRPC) and death usually within
3 years in most men (3). To significantly improve survival
in men with prostate cancer, new therapeutic strategies
to inhibit the appearance of this phenotype must be
developed.
Cancer development is often associated with deletion or
silencing of tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin
homolog (PTEN), a negative regulator of the phosphoinositide
3 kinase (PI3K)–Akt pathway (4), leading to resistance
to various therapies in both preclinical and clinical
trials (5, 6). Therefore, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway plays a
central role in various cellular processes, including protein

synthesis, cell cycle, cell survival, cell growth, motility, and
angiogenesis (7), that can contribute to the malignant
phenotype. Many small-molecule inhibitors targeting PI3K,
Akt, and/or mTOR are currently at various stages of clinical
development. Despite an impressive efficacy in certain
preclinical tumor models (7), clinical responses to smallmolecule
inhibitors of this pathway have been limited,
because PI3K, Akt, or mTOR inhibition typically promotes
growth arrest rather than cell death in solid tumors (8). To
enhance cancer cell killing mediated by Akt inhibitors, the
prosurvival pathways activated in response to the drugs
were investigated. Because mTOR is reported to be a key
node of macroautophagy (hereafter called autophagy) that
provides energy and nutrients to cancer cells during stress by
a cellular self-digestion process (9), autophagy seems to be a
good candidate as an activated survival pathway.
Autophagy is a conserved process by which cells recycle
macromolecules and organelles into specialized doublemembrane
vesicles known as autophagosomes to maintain
homeostasis (10, 11). The formation of autophagosomes is
initiated by class III PI3K and Beclin-1. Then, autophagosomes
fuse with the lysosome, forming autophagolysosomes
promoting intracellular degradation. The abundant
cytoplasmic microtubule-associated protein chain 3 protein
(LC3-I), recruited during the formation of autophagosomes,
is cleaved and lipidated generating the LC3-II form
(12). The hallmark of autophagic activation is, thus, the
formation of cellular autophagosome punctae containing
LC3-II.
So far, the role of autophagy in cancer is controversial, as
the factors that determine whether autophagy induces
tumor cell death or protects tumor cells from unfavorable
conditions have not been clearly elucidated. Autophagy is
reported to play an antitumoral role by reducing the chromosomic
instability, thus avoiding DNA damage (13),
inhibiting cell proliferation (14, 15), and protecting cells
from necrosis and associated inflammation, that could

promote angiogenesis and tumor progression (13, 16). On
the other hand, several studies showed that autophagy is
part of tumor progression during metabolic stresses (17).
Therefore, autophagy acts as an anti-apoptotic mechanism
for tumor cells under stress, maintaining metabolism and
energy needed for survival (13). Moreover, inhibition of
autophagy promotes cancer cell death (18, 19) and potentiates
various anticancer therapies (20–24).
While some prostate cancer cell lines such as LNCaP and
PC346-Flu1 are very sensitive to monotherapy with the AKT
inhibitor AZD5363, where the compound induces significant
apoptosis at concentrations achievable in preclinical
models (25), other prostate cancer cell lines, such as DU145
and PC3, are relatively resistant. Here, we show that the
novel Akt inhibitor AZD5363 activated autophagy in resistant
prostate cell lines and cooperated with chloroquine to
promote cell death in vitro and in vivo in prostate tumor
models. This study strongly shows the attractive prospect of
blocking autophagic processes combined with targeted
therapy as a promising therapeutic approach for prostate
cancer.
Materials and Methods
Tumor cell lines and reagents
The human prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and DU-145
were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(2008 and 1989, respectively; ATCC-authentication by isoenzymes
analysis) and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Invitrogen-Life Technologies)
supplemented with 5% FBS and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine.
All cell lines were cultured in a humidified 5% CO2/air
atmosphere at 37C. All cell lines were passaged for less than
3 months after resurrection.

Therapeutic agents
The Akt inhibitor, AZD5363, was kindly provided from
AstraZeneca and used for in vitro and in vivo studies. The
AZD5363 compound is a novel synthetic Akt inhibitor that
is orally bioavailable. For the in vitro studies, AZD5363 was
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 10 mmol/L
stock solutions and stored at 20C. For the in vivo studies,
AZD5363 was dissolved in PBS 1% carboxymethylcellulose
(CMC) and 0.5% Tween 80 (Invitrogen-Life Technologies)
at 15 mg/mL and stored at 4C. Chloroquine (CHQ; SigmaAldrich)
was dissolved in water for both in vitro and in vivo
experiments at the desired concentrations and stored at 4C.

Cell proliferation and apoptosis assays
Prostate cancer cell lines were plated in appropriate
media (DMEM) with 5% FBS and treated with AZD5363
at indicated concentration and time, and cell growth was
measured using the crystal violet assay as described previously
(26). Detection and quantitation of apoptotic cells
was done by flow cytometry (described in the following)
and Western blotting analysis. Each assay was repeated in
triplicate.
Caspase-3 activity was assessed 3 days after treatment
using the kit CaspACE Assay System, Fluorometric

Translational Relevance
Targeting Akt using a novel inhibitor, AZD5363, activates
autophagy in resistant prostate cell lines and
works synergistically with chloroquine (CHQ) to promote
cell death in vitro and in vivo in prostate tumor
models. We specifically report AZD5363 monotherapy
induced G2 growth arrest and autophagy, but failed to
induce significant apoptosis in PC-3 and DU145 prostate
cancer cell lines. Blocking autophagy using pharmacologic
inhibitors (3-methyladenine, chloroquine,
and bafilomycin A) or genetic inhibitors (siRNA targeting
Atg3 and Atg7) enhanced cell death induced by Akt
inhibitor AZD5363 in these tumor prostate cell lines.
Importantly, the combination of AZD5363 with chloroquine
significantly reduced tumor volume compared
with the control group and compared with either drug
alone in PC3 xenografts.

(Promega). Fifty microgram of total cell lysate were incubated
with caspase-3 substrate AC-DEVD-AMC at room
temperature for 4 hours and caspase-3 activity was quantified
in a fluorometer with excitation at 360 nm and
emission 460 nm.

Cell-cycle analysis
Prostate cancer cell lines were incubated in the absence or
the presence of 10, 50, and 100 mmol/L AZD5363 for 48
hours, trypsinized, washed twice, and incubated in PBS
containing 0.12% Triton X-100, 0.12 mmol/L EDTA, and
100 mg/mL ribonuclease A; 50 mg/mL propidium iodide was
then added to each sample for 20 minutes at 4C. Cell-cycle
distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry (Beckman
Coulter Epics Elite, Beckman), on the basis of 2N and 4N
DNA content. Each assay was done in triplicate.

Western blotting analysis
Samples containing equal amounts of protein (depending
on the antibody, 5–50 mg) from lysates of cultured
tumor prostate cell lines underwent electrophoresis on
SDS-PAGE and were transferred to nitrocellulose filters.
The filters were blocked in Odyssey Blocking Buffer (LICOR
Biosciences) at room temperature for 1 hour and
blots were probed overnight at 4C with 1:1,000 primary
antibodies to detect proteins of interest. After incubation,
the filters were washed 3 times with washing buffer (PBS
containing 0.1% Tween) for 5 minutes. Filters were then
incubated for 1 hour with 1:5,000 diluted Alexa Fluor
secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) at room temperature.
Specific proteins were detected using ODYSSEY IR imaging
system (LI-COR Biosciences) after washing. Antibodies
anti–phospho-Akt (Ser473), anti-Akt, anti-mTOR,
anti-phospho-mTOR, anti-GSK-3B, anti-phospho-GSK3B,

anti-phospho-CDC25C, and anti-phospho-WEE1 from
Cell Signaling Technology; and anti-vinculin and anti–
b-actin from Sigma-Aldrich.

siRNA transfection
Cells were transfected with antisense or siRNA as
described previously (27, 28). The sequence of Atg3 siRNA
corresponds to the human Atg3 site (50
-GGAAUCAAAGUUUAAGGAAACAGGU-30;
Invitrogen Life Technologies).
A scrambled siRNA (50
-CAGCGCUGACAACAGUUUCAU-30;
Dharmacon) was used as a control for RNA interference
experiments.

Immunofluorescence
Tumor cells were grown on coverslips and treated with
AZD5363 at indicated concentrations and indicated time.
After treatment, cells were fixed in ice-cold methanol completed
with 3% acetone for 10 minutes at 20C. Cells were
the washed 3 times with PBS and incubated with 0.2%
Triton/PBS for 10 minutes, followed by washing and 30
minutes blocking in 3% nonfat milk before the addition of
antibody overnight to detect LC-3 (1:250). Antigens were

visualized using anti-mouse antibody coupled with fluorescence
isothiocyanate (FITC; 1:500; 30 minutes). Photomicrographs
were taken at 20 magnification using a Zeiss
Axioplan II fluorescence microscope, followed by analysis
with imaging software (Northern Eclipse; Empix Imaging).
Puncta from 100 to 150 cells were counted from 3 independent
experiments for quantitative analysis as described
previously (29). Cells displaying more than 15 brightly
fluorescent LC3 puncta were counted as positive. Photomicrographs
were taken at 40 magnification using a Zeiss
Axioplan II fluorescence microscope.

Animal treatment
To establish PC-3 or DU145 tumors, 2  106 cells were
inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) in the flank of 6- to 8-
week-old male athymic mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley).
When tumors reached 100 mm3
, usually 3 to 4 weeks after
injection, mice were randomly assigned to vehicle,
AZD5363 alone, chloroquine alone or AZD5363 þ CHQ.
AZD5363 (150 mg/kg; formulation in 0.5% CMC þ 0.5%
Tween-80) was administered orally twice daily and chloroquine
(15 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally once
daily. Each experimental group consisted of 10 mice. Tumor
volume was measured twice weekly (length  width
depth  0.5432). Data points were expressed as average
tumor volume  standard error of the mean (SEM).
When tumor volume reached at least 10% or more of
body weight, mice were sacrificed and tumors harvested for
evaluation of protein expression by Western blotting analyses
and immunohistochemistry. All animal procedures
were carried out according to the guidelines of the Canadian
Council on Animal Care and appropriate institutional
certification.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical stains were carried out on formalin-fixed
and paraffin-embedded 4-mm sections of tumor
samples using adequate primary antibody (Supplementary
materials), and the Ventana autostainer Discover XT (Ventana
Medical System) with enzyme-labeled biotin streptavidin
system and the solvent-resistant 3,30
-diaminobenyidine
Map kit. All comparisons of staining intensities were
made at 200 magnifications.

Statistical analysis
All in vitro data were assessed using the Student t test and
Mann–Whitney test. Tumor volumes of mice were compared
using the Kruskal–Wallis test. Overall survival was
analyzed using Kaplan–Meier curves and statistical significance
between the groups was assessed with the log-rank
test (Graphpad Prism). Levels of statistical significance were
set at P less than 0.05.

(Akt 1, 2, and 3; ref. 25). Although these 3 isoforms are
encoded by separate genes, they share a common NH2
-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a catalytic
domain in the middle, and a COOH terminus (30, 31). The
identity of the overall amino acid sequence of the 3 isoforms
is very high (80%); however, the COOH terminus and the
PH-linker region are more diverse (31). AZD5363 downregulates
the phosphorylation of downstream pathway
proteins in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B and C), as
evaluated by Western blot in PC-3 and DU145 prostate cell
lines. Indeed, AZD5363 reduced phospho-mTOR, phospho-S6,
and phospho-GSK-3b proteins, clearly showing
that the compound inhibits AKT substrates and pathway
across the dose range. However, consistent with data in
other cell lines, phosphorylation of Akt was increased in a
dose-dependent manner in both PC-3 and DU145 cells
(25).

Biological effects of AZD5363 on PC-3 and DU145
prostate cell lines
To determine the biological activity of AZD5363 on cell
proliferation, we compared PC-3 and DU145 cell lines with
LNCaP cells, which are known to be very sensitive to
AZD5363 (25). AZD5363 reduced LNCaP cell viability in
a dose- and time-dependent manner (90% inhibition

after 3 days at 200 nmol/L and >90% reduction in cell
proliferation after 2 days at 10 mmol/L). In contrast, PC-3
and DU145 cell viability was only slightly affected in dosedependent
manner after 24 hours and, indeed, cell number
increased after 1 day, indicating insensitivity and innate
resistance of these cancer cells to AZD5363 (Fig. 2A). We
next examined the effect of AZD5363 inhibitor on cell-cycle
repartition in PC-3 and DU145 cancer cell lines compared
with sensitive LNCaP cells. While a low dose of AZD5363
enhances the sub-G0/G1 phase (Supplementary Fig. S1A)
and increases cleaved-PARP in the sensitive LNCaP cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1B), PC-3 and DU145 cells show a
slight G2/M arrest (increasing by 1.5–2-fold the cell population
after 50 mmol/L AZD5363 relative to control) after
AZD5363 treatment compared with untreated cells (Fig.
2B). These results were associated with decreased phosphoCDC2,
phospho-CDC25C, and phospho-WEE1 expression
in PC-3 and DU145 cell lines (Fig. 2C). No significant
change was observed in the sub-G0/G1 phase after treatment
with 10 mmol/L, even with a high concentration 50 mmol/L
of AZD5363 (5-fold higher than the concentration
achieved at a maximum dose tolerated in nude mice)
compared with control (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that
AZD5363 fails to induce apoptosis in PC-3 and DU145
prostate cell lines at a concentration that reflects maximal

tolerated doses in preclinical mouse models (Fig. 2B). This
result was confirmed by immunoblot analysis, showing that
AZD5363 did not induce cleaved caspase-3 or cleaved PARP
in PC-3 and DU145 cells (Fig. 2D), while other drugs
(staurosporine or MG132) induce apoptosis in these cell
lines (Supplementary Fig. S2A).

AZD5363 induces autophagy by inhibiting Akt/mTOR/
p70S6K signaling pathway in prostate cells
Having shown downregulation of the Akt downstream
pathway, including inhibition of mTOR pathway (Fig. 1A)
and a growth arrest without apoptosis induction (Fig. 2), we
focused on autophagy as a mechanism inducing cell survival
rather than apoptosis (20). We investigated autophagy

induction in tumor prostate cells after AZD5363 treatment
and found that AZD5363 induces autophagosome formation,
as measured by puncta of LC3 fusion protein in PC3
prostate cancer cells compared with untreated cells (75% of
positive cells after AZD5363 treatment vs. 23% of positive
cells in Ctrl condition; Fig. 3A and B). The level of autophagy
induction was comparable with that induced by rapamycin,
an mTOR inhibitor known to induce autophagy
(32). Similar to that with rapamycin treatment (Supplementary
Fig. S2B), immunoblotting revealed that AZD5363
induced the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II in a dose- and
time-dependent manner (Fig. 3C and D). We next examined
if AZD5363 induces autophagy in vivo. Mice treated with
AZD5363 show an induction of autophagy as indicated by

untreated mice (Fig. 3E).

Blocking autophagy enhances induction of apoptosis
by AZD5363 in vitro
Considering that autophagy may function as a stressactivated
prosurvival mechanism in prostate cancer cells
(20, 23), we hypothesized that inhibiting the autophagy
pathway could promote cell death when combined with
AZD5363. First, PC-3 cells were treated with AZD5363,
followed by brief exposure to pharmacologic inhibitors of
autophagy, bafilomycin A (Baf A), which inhibits vacuolartype
Hþ-ATPase, thus blocking autophagosome maturation
(33), chloroquine which disrupts the function of lysosomes,
and 3-methyladenine (3-MA) which inhibits early
stages of autophagosome formation (34). As shown in Fig.
4A, cell viability is significantly reduced when AZD5363 is
combined with Baf A, chloroquine, or 3-MA compared with
either drug alone (Fig. 4A). This result is accompanied by
increased apoptosis as shown by enhancing cleaved PARP
level with combination treatment compared with monotherapy
AZD5363, Baf A, or chloroquine (Fig. 4B). Furthermore,
BafA- or chloroquine-treated cells showed increased
conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II (Fig. 4B), likely due to

autophagosome accumulation (35). This increased conversion
of LC3-I to LC3-II was higher when Baf A or chloroquine
was combined with AZD5363. These results were
confirmed using another PI3K inhibitor, PI-103, further
showing that targeting Akt induced a decrease of cell proliferation
(Supplementary Fig. S3A), enhanced cleaved
PARP with combination treatment compared with monotherapy
PI-103 or chloroquine, and increased conversion of
LC3-I to LC3-II (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
To exclude off-target pharmacologic effects of drugs inhibiting
autophagy, we treated cells with siRNAs directed
against ATG3 and ATG7, which are required for autophagosome
formation (36). The knock-down of the expression of
endogenous ATG-3 or ATG-7 induced cell death by increasing
significantly the sub-G1 fraction when combined with
AZD5363, compared with control siRNA-treated cells (Fig.
4C and D). This cell death is due to enhanced apoptosis, as
evidenced by a pronounced increase in casapase-3/7 activity
after combined treatment AZD5363 with siATG-3 or siATG7,
relative to control siRNA (Fig. 4C and D). Taken together,
these data strongly indicate that autophagy protects tumor
cells from cell death induced by AZ5363 and, then, blocking
autophagy contributes to apoptosis when combined with
AZD5363.

Figure 4. Targeting autophagy enhances AZD5363 activity to induce apoptosis in PC-3 tumor prostate cells. PC3 cells were treated with 10 mmol/L AZD5363
alone or in combination with 10 nmol/L Baf A, or 1 mmol/L 3-MA, or 20 mmol/L chloroquine (CHQ) for 48 hours. Cell proliferation was determined by
crystal violet (A). Protein extracts were analyzed by Western blotting for LC3, P62, Akt, p-Akt, p-S6 and PARP (B). C and D, PC3 cells were transiently
transfected with negative control siRNA (siScr1), siAtg3, or siATG7. PC-3 cell death was assessed by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry
analysis after 48 hours. Western blotting analysis or caspase-3/7 activity was determined on the cell lysates and the results are expressed in arbitrary units and
corrected for protein content. , P < 0.001;  , P < 0.01; , P < 0.05.

Autophagy inhibition potentiates in vivo activity of
clinical inhibitor AZD5363 in prostate xenograft model
To further investigate the therapeutic benefit of inhibiting
autophagy in combination with AZD5363, we used chloroquine,
which has been used in the clinical setting for more
than 50 years for treatment of malaria and autoimmune
disease. Using the PC-3 and DU145 cell lines, we showed
that AZD5363 and chloroquine could cooperate to induce
apoptosis in vitro as shown by PARP cleavage and caspase-3
activity compared with either agent alone. To translate these
resultsin vivo, we used prostate xenograft models from PC-3
and DU145. When chloroquine was combined with
AZD5363, the PC3 xenograft growth was reduced by
80% compared with untreated mice or those treated with
AZD5363 or chloroquine monotherapy (Fig. 5A). The
tumor doubling time was 2-fold longer with combination
therapy (0.8 month) compared with either drug alone
(0.4 month; Fig. 5B). Moreover, all animals treated with a
combination of AZD5363 and chloroquine survived after
64 days, while 80% of untreated mice and 30% to 40% of

mice treated with monotherapy AZD5363 or chloroquine
acquired tumor burden that required euthanasia (Fig. 5C).
No significant changes in overall body weight or behavior
were observed in all mice. Similar results were observed in
the DU145 xenograft model (Fig. 5D–F).
Analyses of treated tumors confirmed that the combination
treatment of AZD5363 and chloroquine significantly
inhibited the Akt pathway and induced marked increases in
apoptosis (Fig. 6A and B). Indeed, p-S6 staining decreased
by 40% in the AZD5363 monotherapy group and by 90%
after combination treatment, respectively. In addition,
TUNEL staining (indicating degree of cell death) showed
a large increase after combination treatment, while Ki-67
expression decreased by approximately 90%, indicating
reduction in cell proliferation. To detect LC3 and subsequently
distinguish between the diffuse localization of LC3-
I and the punctea of LC3-II in tumor tissue, only the dark
punctea were counted as positive cells of LC3-II. Either drug
alone increased autophagy by 2-fold relative to untreated
mice, while the combination of AZD5363 and chloroquine

Chloroquine Sensitizes Prostate Tumor Cells to AZD5363

increased LC3-II by 3.5-fold, corroborating with the in vitro
data. In parallel to this LC3-II increase, a drastic degradation
of the autophagy substrate p62 in tumor tissue was observed
after AZD5363 treatment, whereas chloroquine slightly
increased p62 expression compared with the untreated
group (Fig. 6A), implying that the accumulation of LC3-
II is associated with autophagosome degradation. Chloroquine
combined with AZD5363 partially blocked the p62
degradation induced by AZD5363 (Fig. 6A). Moreover, our
data showed that Ki-67 decreases with combination therapy
while apoptosis increases. These data showed clearly that
the combination therapy overwhelmed the cells and shifted
autophagy from survival to apoptosis. These data confirmed
our in vitro results and provide support that inhibition of
autophagy sensitizes the antitumor effect of AZD5363 on
prostate cancer cells.

Discussion
Signaling through the PI3K–Akt pathway controls proliferation
and apoptosis of cancer cells (37, 38) by modulating
cell-cycle and apoptosis-regulatory proteins (39).
Genetic inactivation of PTEN through either gene deletion
or mutation is common in metastatic prostate cancer leading
to Akt/PKB activation (40). Indeed, expression of phosphorylated
Akt (Ser473) is correlated with advanced human
prostate cancer (41) and associated with poor clinical
outcome (42), highlighting the therapeutic interest to target
Akt/PKB in prostate cancer.
AZD5363, a potent pan-Akt kinase inhibitor, inhibits the
growth of a range of human tumor xenografts as a monotherapy
(25), including prostate cancer. On the basis of
these data, AZD5363 is currently being investigated in phase
1 clinical trials. However, we found a difference of therapeutic
response of AZD5363 to induce apoptosis in different
prostate cancer cell lines. Indeed, our data indicate that,
in contrast to LNCaP and PC346C-Flu1 cells where a
concentration of 1 mmol/L AZD5363 is sufficient to induce
apoptosis, AZD5363 can cause cell-cycle delay without
promoting significant apoptosis in PC-3 and DU-145 prostate
tumor cells.
Inhibition of Akt signaling using AZD5363 induces
autophagy in prostate cells through downregulation of the
mTOR pathway. Autophagy may promote cell survival or
apoptosis in different cellular contexts. Indeed, autophagy
may act as a protective mechanism in tumor cells against
treatment with cytotoxic agents (16, 20, 43); understanding
the consequences of autophagy is necessary to rationalize
the potential of combination therapies to block this process
and to sensitize the tumor cells to targeted therapies such as
Akt inhibitors. In our study, inhibiting autophagy by using
inhibitors (Baf A, 3-MA, or chloroquine) acting at different
stage of the autolysosome formation enhances AZD5363
activity to induce apoptosis in PC-3 and DU-145 prostate
cancer cell lines. All these data suggest that autophagy plays
a protective role in the survival and growth of these 2
prostate cancer cell lines. Recently, Bray and colleagues
reported that inhibition of mTOR pathway stimulates

autophagy and eliminates RIP kinases (RIPKs; ref. 44).
Moreover, combined mTOR and autophagy inhibition
leads to an increase of ROS production, causing necroptosis
(44). Our data show clearly that neither AZD5363 (Akt
inhibitor) nor PI-103 (PI3K inhibitor) has an effect on
RIPKs while rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor) induces a
decrease of RIPKs expression (Supplementary Fig. S4A). In
addition, we show that both rapamycin and PI-103 induce
ROS production while AZD5363 failed to induce it (Supplementary
Fig. S4B). Our data strongly suggest that
AZD5363 induces autophagy independent of RIPKs or ROS
production.
Recently, several studies have reported that chloroquine
has other biologic effects in addition to blocking
autophagy, including inhibition of cell proliferation, and
induction of apoptosis (45–47). It follows that the mechanism
of sensitization of chloroquine to different drugs is
currently controversial. Indeed, Maycotte and colleagues
reported that chloroquine sensitizes breast cancer cells to
cisplatin independently of autophagy inhibition or, more
precisely, independently of Atg12 or beclin 1 (48). Previous
reports have shown that PI3K pathway inhibitors,
combined with chloroquine or other lysosomotropic
agents, increased cell death in breast (49) or glioma
(23) cell lines. In our study, we have shown that 3
different inhibitors (Baf A, 3-MA, or chloroquine) blocking
autophagy at different stages of this process sensitize
prostate tumor cells to AZD5363, leading to cell death.
This supports the interpretation that inhibition of autophagy
is likely to be a mechanism that contributes to the
therapeutic benefit of giving chloroquine in combination
with AZD5363. Moreover, the specific knockdown of
ATG3 or ATG7 induced apoptosis when combined with
AZD5363 in prostate cancer cells as lysosomotropic
agents, confirming that the inhibition of autophagy sensitizes
tumor cells to apoptosis induced by this Akt
inhibitor.
Chloroquine has been used for decades for the treatment
of malaria and rheumatoid arthritis, and has been shown to
achieve some level of anti-HIV activity (50). Chloroquine is
also known to be an inhibitor of autophagy by blocking
acidification of the lysosome, preventing fusion with autophagosome
(51) and, thus, represents a clinical opportunity.
Currently, around 20 clinical trials are ongoing involving
chloroquine as an autophagy inhibitor to potentiate the
effects of targeted therapies (such as bortezomib, temsirolimus,
or gemcitabine) in various cancers (52). Many of
them have evidence of preliminary antitumor activity. In
our study, we showed that blockade of autophagy at the
level of lysosomal trafficking using chloroquine led to
enhanced tumor cell death in response to AZD5363 and
prolonged the overall survival in 2 prostate tumor xenograft
models, as shown by increasing TUNEL expression and by
decreasing Ki-67 expression in tumor tissues. Our data
highlight the importance of autophagy as a survival signal
in response to targeting the PI3K–Akt axis in prostate cancer.
Although we do not exclude the possibility that effects
of chloroquine are limited to inhibition of autophagy,

we propose that chloroquine-mediated inhibition of
autophagy has the potential to enhance the efficacy of
AZD5363-mediated inhibition of Akt/PKB signaling and
should be considered as a combination therapy in prostate
cancer.
