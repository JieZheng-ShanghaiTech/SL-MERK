Abstract
The
concept of synthetic lethality (the creation of a lethal phenotype
from the combined effects of mutations in two or more genes) has recently
been exploited in various efforts to develop new genotype-selective
anticancer therapeutics. These efforts include screening for novel
anticancer agents, identifying novel therapeutic targets, characterizing
mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapy, and improving efficacies
through the rational design of combination therapy. This review discusses
recent developments in synthetic lethality anticancer therapeutics,
including poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors for
BRCA1
- and
BRCA2-
mutant cancers, checkpoint inhibitors
for p53 mutant cancers, and small molecule agents targeting
RAS
gene mutant cancers. Because cancers are caused by mutations
in multiple genes and abnormalities in multiple signaling pathways,
synthetic lethality for a specific tumor suppressor gene or oncogene
is likely cell context-dependent. Delineation of the mechanisms underlying
synthetic lethality and identification of treatment response biomarkers
will be critical for the success of synthetic lethality anticancer
therapy.Introduction
Genetic and epigenetic alterations that
lead to the functional
deregulations of several signaling and metabolic pathways are known
to be the major driving forces behind carcinogenesis and cancer progression.
1
Those functional deregulations in cancer cells
have been exploited for pathway-targeted anticancer therapy. Small
molecules and antibodies that directly inhibit critical nodes in oncogenic
signaling networks, most notably kinases or enzymes, have been used
to treat various cancers in humans,
1
,
2
resulting in
substantial improvement in clinical symptoms and outcomes in a subset
of cancer patients. However, many critical nodes in oncogenic signaling
networks may not be targeted directly by small molecules or antibodies.
For example, functional losses in tumor suppressor genes caused by
gene mutations or deletions may not be restored through small molecules.
Moreover, the functions of some intracellular oncogene products, such
as RAS and c-MYC, have been found to be difficult to modulate directly
through small molecules.
3
Nevertheless,
functional alterations in nondruggable targets may lead to changes
in signal transduction and metabolism that render the mutant cells
more susceptible to functional changes in other genes or to pharmaceutical
interventions aimed at other targets, providing an opportunity to
selectively eliminate those mutant cells through synthetic lethality.
Synthetic lethality (the creation of a lethal phenotype from the combined
effects of mutations in two or more genes
4
) offers the potential to eliminate malignant cells by indirectly
targeting cancer-driving molecules that are difficult to target directly
with small molecules or antibodies.
The concept of synthetic
lethality is illustrated in Figure
​
Figure1A.

A. The
two genes
A
and
B
are synthetic
lethal if the mutations in any one of them
will not change the viability of a cell or an organism, but simultaneous
mutations in both
A
and
B
genes
will result in a lethal phenotype. This concept has has been used
in genetic studies to determine functional interactions and compensation
among genes for decades

and has recently
been exploited for the development of new genotype-selective anticancer
agents,

For example, if gene

in Figure

1
B is mutated, small interfering RNA (siRNA) or small
molecules targeting the genes
X
,
Y
, or
Z
would likely induce synthetic lethality in
cells with an abberant
A
but not in the cells with
a wild-type
A
. Therefore, using paired isogenic cell
lines with and without abberant
A
, one can screen
for siRNA or compounds that specifically kill the cells with an abberant
A

represent wild types, while

and

represent mutants. Synthetic lethality refers
to a lethal phenotype observed only in the combination group of
A
–
and
B
–
. (B) An essential survival function
is regulated by two pathways conducted by A, B, C and X, Y, X, respectively.
A functional change in either of these pathways is insufficient to
induce viability changes. However, the simultaneous presence of mutations
or dysfunctions in both pathways, such as a mutation in A and any
mutation in X, Y, or Z, induces lethal phenotype. Thus, A is synthetic
lethal with X, Y, and Z, and vice versa. (C) An essential survival
function is regulated by pathway A alone, in which A2 is a multiprotein
complex composed of X, Y, and Z; and A3 has homologues of α,
β and γ. Synthetic lethality may exist among X, Y, and
Z and among A3α, β, and γ.
Several models of interactions among genes and/or proteins
have
been proposed to account for synthetic lethality,
15
,
16
including the components of parallel pathways that together regulate
an essential biological function, the presence of homologous genes
or protein isomers derived from the same ancestral gene (paralogs),
subunits of an essential multiprotein complex, and components of a
single linear essential pathway (Figure
​
(Figure1B,C).
Studies
1
B,C).
Studies in yeast revealed that synthetic lethal interactions occurred
significantly more frequently among genes with the same mutant phenotype,
among genes encoding proteins with the same subcellular localization,
and among genes involved in similar biological processes, such as
those in parallel or compensating pathways or bridging bioprocesses.
17
For a particular tumor suppressor gene or oncogene,
synthetic lethality can be identified by using isogenic cell lines
to screen an siRNA library for synthetic lethal genes or a chemical
library for synthetic lethal compounds. This review discusses recent
advances in the development of synthetic lethality based anticancer
therapeutics. In particular, it emphasizes the development of anticancer
agents that target DNA damage response and oncogene Ras pathways through
a synthetic lethality approach.DNA Damage Response Pathway
The
TP53
gene, which encodes tumor suppressor
protein p53, a master transcriptional regulator of cellular response
to DNA damage, is commonly inactivated in about 50% of human cancers
by either gene mutations or degradation through HDM2.
18
,
19
Moreover, pathways involved in DNA damage response are often constitutively
activated in a majority of tumors, even in early stages of tumor development
and in tumor specimens from untreated patients, presumably because
of oncogene-mediated deregulation of DNA replication.
20
Different mechanisms are used in cells in response
to different
types of DNA damage. Single-strand breaks (SSBs) activate poly ADP-ribose
polymerase (PARP) and are repaired mainly by PARP-mediated base-excision
repair, while double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired by the mechanisms
of homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ).
21
PARP can be activated by binding to SSBs,
22
−
24
leading to SSB repair through base excision mechanisms (Figure
​
(Figure2).
2
). However, if SSBs are not repaired, they will
cause a blockage or collapse of DNA replication forks during DNA synthesis
and the formation of DSBs. DSBs can also be incurred by endogenous
and exogenous DNA-damaging agents such as ionizing radiation.
Open in a separate window
Figure 2
DNA damage
repair pathways. Single-strand break (SSB), double-strand
break (DSB), and single strand DNA derived from DNA damage or stalled
replication fork are recognized by various sensor molecules (marked
yellow), leading to activation of signal transducers (marked green),
which in turn activate different DNA repair pathways and checkpoint
pathways, thereby preventing transmission of the genetic lesion to
the daughter cells. Those parallel pathways provide opportunities
of eliminating some cancer cells with mutations in those pathways
through synthetic lethality.
DSBs are detected by the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 complex or by Ku70/Ku80
heterodimers. The single-strand DNA present at stalled replication
forks or generated by processing of DSBs is recognized by replication
protein A (RPA).
25
The assembly of those
sensor molecules in the damaged DNA sites leads to the recruitment
and activation of signal transducers, including three phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase related kinases (PIKKs) (ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM),
ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR), and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK))
that in turn activate downstream effectors, resulting in the activation
of checkpoint and DNA repair pathways.
25
,
26
The phosphorylation
of H2AX by ATM, ATR, or DNA-PK at S139 (known as γH2AX) triggers
the recruitment of DNA repair proteins and leads to the assembly of
DNA repair complexes at the damaged DNA sites.
25
,
27
Consequently, the cell cycle progression is arrested to permit the
repair of the damaged DNA, thereby preventing transmission of the
genetic lesion to the daughter cells (Figure
​
(Figure2
2
).
Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 are required for the assembly of protein
complexes
for HR, including recruitment of recombinase RAD51 to the DNA DSBs.
28
,
29
DSB repair through HR is mostly error free and can occur only in
the late S and G2 phases of the cell cycle because it requires an
intact sister chromatid as a template for repair. In contrast, NHEJ
involves Ku70/80, DNA-PK, XRCC4, and DNA ligase IV, often results
in gene deletion or translocation, and can occur in all phases of
the cell cycle.
25
Most NHEJ occurs independent
of the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 complex and ATM activation because the Ku70/Ku80
heterodimer can directly bind to the ends of double-strand DNA, recruit
DNA-PK to the site, and initiate an NHEJ process.
30
In the absence of Ku proteins, an alternative NHEJ initiates
with the involvement of PARP1, XRCC1, and ligase I/III
31
(Figure
​
(Figure2
2
).PARP and PARP
Inhibitors
PARP is a group of ADP-ribose transferase enzymes
that catalyze
polyADP-ribosylation of proteins by transferring ADP-ribose groups
from the donor substrate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD
+
) to glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and lysine residues in
the acceptor proteins, thereby regulating the functions of those proteins.
Seventeen PARP family members have been identified in humans.
32
DNA-dependent PARP subfamily members PARPs 1–3
have been reported to regulate various DNA damage response processes.
The recognition and binding to damaged DNA structures by PARP1 and
PARP2, either through their own DNA binding domain or through interaction
with damaged DNA-binding protein 2,
22
−
24
lead to the activation
of their enzymatic activity and the polymerization of ADP-ribose units
of a number of proteins, including PARP1/2, histones, topoisomerase,
and DNA-PK.
33
,
34
The polyADP-ribose on those proteins
provides a docking site for recruiting cell cycle checkpoint proteins
and DNA repair proteins (e.g., p53, XRCC1, DNA-PK, Ku70, and ATM)
to the sites of DNA lesions,
35
−
38
thereby regulating various processes of DNA repair,
including base-excision repair, HR, and NHEJ. PARP1 regulates base-excision
repair by interaction with XRCC1,
39
DNA
polymerase β,
40
and the base-excision
repair enzymes apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1
41
and ALC1.
42
PARP1
also interacts with DNA-PK and Ku and is required for an alternative
and PARP-dependent NHEJ pathway.
43
,
44
Moreover,
PARP1 participates in HR by interacting with MRE11 and ATM.
36
,
45
Although
PARP1
–/–
embryonic stem cells and embryonic fibroblasts exhibit normal
repair of DNA DSBs and RAD51 foci formation,
46
PARP1
–/–
mice have increased deletion mutations and insertions and/or rearrangements
in vivo after treatment with the alkylating agent
N
-nitrosobis(2-hydroxypropyl)amine.
47
Interestingly,
PARP1
–/–
mice
are viable and fertile and do not develop spontaneous tumors, possibly
because of functional compensation from PARP2, as PARP1 and PARP2
double knockout is embryonically lethal.
48
Nevertheless,
PARP1
–/–
mice or cells exhibit defective DNA SSB repair and increased
HR, sister chromatid exchange, and chromosome instability.
49
PARP1, but not PARP2, is required for the survival
of cells with defects in the HR pathway because knockdown of both
PARP1
and
BRCA2
significantly reduces the
survival of human cells, whereas knockdown of both
PARP2
and
BRCA2
has no effect on cell survival.
50
The mechanisms underlying the synthetic lethality
of
PARP1
and
BRCA
genes are still
not clear, although evidence suggests that it might be caused by the
deregulation of NHEJ,
51
increased spontaneous
DNA breaks that need to be repaired by HR,
52
or the suppression of BRCA and RAD51 expression by E2F4/p130-mediated
transcriptional repression
53
caused by
PARP1 inhibition.
The synthetic lethality of
PARP1
and
BRCR1/2
genes reported in 2005 by Farmer et
al.
6
and Bryant et al.
50
sparked much interest
in the concept of using PARP inhibitors to selectively eliminate
BRCA1
or
BRCA2
mutant tumor cells. Germ
line mutations in
BRCA
genes predispose carriers
to breast, ovarian, and other cancers in an autosomal dominant manner,
54
,
55
with 50–80% penetrance for breast cancer and 30–50%
for ovarian cancer.
56
Early studies revealed
that PARP1 activation facilitates DNA repair and maintenance of genomic
integrity and is required for recovery from DNA damage in mice and
in cells.
49
However, excessive PARP1 activation
leads to cell death because of overconsumption and depletion of NAD
+
and ATP in the cells, whereas genetic disruption or pharmaceutical
inhibition of PARP protects animals from ischemia-induced brain and
heart damage.
57
,
58
In addition, PARP1 was found
to regulate the transcriptional activity of NFκB and other inflammation-related
transcription factors, promoting the expression of inflammation mediators.
59
Thus, PARP inhibitors have been investigated
for the therapeutic benefits of protecting tissue from ischemia-induced
injury, suppressing inflammation, and sensitizing cancer cells to
DNA damage-based anticancer therapy.
60
,
61
Several excellent
review articles have discussed the development of PARP inhibitors.
32
,
61
−
63
Briefly, PARP inhibitors used in clinical investigation
mostly compete with the ADP-ribose donor substrate NAD
+
and inhibit both PARP1 and PARP2. A binding assay with catalytic
domains from 13 of the 17 human PARP family members revealed that
many of the best known PARP inhibitors, including those used in clinical
studies such as olaparib (
1
), veliparib (
2
), and rucaparib (
3
) (Figure
​
(Figure3),
3
), bind to several PARP family members, suggesting nonspecific activity
of those inhibitors.

Figure 3
Structures of PARP inhibitors.
PARP inhibitors are currently
under intensive investigations as
therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancers with deficiencies
in BRCA or other DNA repair proteins. An initial preclinical study
by Farmer et al. revealed that the
BRCA1/2
-defective
cells were 57- to 133-fold more sensitive to PARP inhibitors KU0058684
(
4
) and KU0058948 (
5
) than wild-type cells.
6
At the same time, Bryant et al.
50
showed that HR-defective cells with a deficiency in XRCC2,
XRCC3, or BRCA2 (XRCC11) were killed by PARP inhibitors such as NU1025
(
6
) and AG14361 (
7
) at concentrations that
were nontoxic to normal cells.
65
Recent
studies revealed that defects in other DNA repair proteins, such as
ATM,
66
MRE11,
67
ERCC1,
68
and p53
69
or PTEN,
70
also induce synthetic lethality
with the PARP inhibitors. A high-throughput RNA interference screen
for 230 known and putative DNA repair proteins revealed additional
genes that have synthetic lethality with compound
5
,
including ATR, PCNA, RAD51, and XRCC1.
71
A similar study with a novel potent PARP1/2 inhibitor (BMN 673)
(
8
) and an siRNA library targeting 960 genes, including
kinases and kinase-related genes, tumor suppressors, and DNA repair
proteins, showed synthetic lethality of
8
with HR and
DSB repair genes.
72
Moreover, PARP1 inhibitors
induced synthetic lethality in cancer cells with positive E26 transformation-specific
gene fusions
73
and with EGFR inhibitors.
74
Because of the critical roles of PARP1 in the
DNA repair process, PARP inhibitors have also been intensively tested
for sensitizing radiotherapy and chemotherapy that induces DNA damage.
Compounds
1
and
2
are the most extensively
investigated inhibitors in clinical trials for the treatment of BRCA1/2-mutated
cancers. Other PARP inhibitors under clinical trials are niraparib
(MK-4827) (
9
),
3
, and
8
. A
phase I study of the combination therapy of rucaparib with temzolomide
in patients with advanced solid tumors showed that
3
at
a dose of 12 mg/m
2
inhibited 74–97% of PARP activity
in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A dose of 12 mg/m
2
3
in combination with 200 mg/m
2
temozolomide
was tolerated, with a dose-limiting toxicity of myelosuppression.
75
A phase II study of intravenous administration
of 12 mg/m
2
3
with temozolomide in patients
with metastatic melanoma showed that 150–200 mg m
–2
day
–1
temozolomide can be safely given in the
combination therapy, with a response rate of about 17% and an increase
in progression-free survival over historical controls in metastatic
melanoma patients.
76
Phase I clinical trials
with compound
1
in recurrent/advanced cancer patients
with or without
BRCA1/2
mutations
77
,
78
revealed that the maximum tolerated dose for
1
was
400 mg twice daily, with dose-limiting toxicities of mood alteration,
fatigue, and thrombocytopenia. Clinical benefit was observed in 30–60%
of
BRCA1/2
mutant breast or ovarian cancer patients.
77
,
78
The pharmacokinetics study revealed a maximum concentration of 2.6–4.8
μg/mL at doses of 400 mg twice daily. The mean maximal PARP
inhibitions in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumor tissues
were 50% and 70%, respectively.
79
Mean
terminal half-life was about 7–11 h.
80
Subsequently,
1
has been evaluated in combination therapy
with various conventional anticancer agents, including cisplatin and
gemcitabine, topotecan, bevacizumab, dacarbazine, and the VEGFR inhibitor
cediranib.
81
,
82
The overall response rates were
variable, from 0% to 44%.
A phase II comparison study of
1
versus liposomal
doxorubicin treatment for
BRCA1/2
mutant ovarian
cancer patients who had recurrent tumors after platinum therapy revealed
overall response rates of 25–31%, not significantly different
from that of doxorubicin alone (18%).
83
Phase I trials of a combination of
2
(half-life of
about 5 h) with cyclophosphamide or topotecan
84
in refractory solid tumors and lymphomas showed promising activity
in a subset of patients with
BRCA
mutations. The
maximum tolerated dose was defined as 60 mg of
2
with
50 mg of cyclophosphamide once daily or 0.6 mg m
–2
day
–1
topotecan administered intravenously on
days 1–5 and 10 mg of
2
twice daily on days 1–5
in 21-day cycles. PARP activity was significantly inhibited in peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (by 50%) and in tumor biopsies (by 80%). A
phase II trial of the combination compared with single-agent cyclophosphamide
is ongoing for cases of
BRCA
mutant ovarian cancer,
triple-negative breast cancer, and low-grade lymphoma. The dose-limiting
toxicity was myelosuppression. A phase 1 dose-escalation trial of
9
in
BRCA
mutation carriers and patients
with sporadic cancer revealed a maximum tolerated dose of 300 mg/day.
Dose-limiting toxicities were fatigue, pneumonitis, and thrombocytopenia.
The maximum concentration at 300 mg/day was about 2000–4000
nM. The mean terminal elimination half-life was 36.4 h. Pharmacodynamic
analyses confirmed that PARP inhibition exceeded 50% at doses greater
than 80 mg/day, and antitumor activity was documented at doses beyond
60 mg/day. Clinical benefit was observed in 40–50% of
BRCA1/2
mutation carriers with ovarian or breast cancer.
Antitumor activity was also reported in sporadic high-grade serous
ovarian cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, and prostate cancer.
85
A phase I study of
8
in solid tumors
showed that RECIST and/or CA-125 response occurred at doses of >100
μg/day in 11/17
BRCA
carrier ovarian/peritoneal
cancer patients.
86
In summary, the results
from these clinical studies revealed that myelosuppression is the
major dose-limiting toxicity of various PARP inhibitors and that clinical
benefit is variable in the single-agent and combination therapies,
with significant benefit observed in
BRCA
mutant
cancers, consistent with the findings in the preclinical studies.Checkpoint
Inhibitors
The ATM/checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2) and ATR/CHK1
signaling pathways
regulate many common downstream proteins, including p53, CDC25 phosphatases,
and Wee1 kinase, thereby regulating G1, S, and G2/M checkpoints (Figure
​
(Figure4).
4
). Because activation of oncogenes can cause replication
stress and DNA damage, inhibiting checkpoint pathways may trigger
synthetic lethality in cancer cells by enhancing the DNA damage-induced
apoptosis or senescence, which may be modulated by p53 status. Phosphorylation
of p53 on S15 by ATM/ATR and/or on S20 by CHK1/CHK2 stabilizes p53
protein
87
−
89
and up-regulates the expression of p21 (also known
as CIP1/WAF1), an inhibitor of cyclin E/cyclin-dependent kinase 2
(CDK2) that controls G1/S progression. In contrast, phosphorylation
of CDC25 phosphatases by CHK1/CHK2 promotes degradation of CDC25,
which is required for dephosphorylation and activation of cyclin B/CDK1
kinases that control the transition of G2/M phases
90
(Figure
​
(Figure4).
4
). Evidence has shown that
ATR/CHK1 is critical in regulating the activity of CDC25 and S/G2
checkpoints.
91
,
92
Although p53 also regulates the
G2 checkpoint,
93
G2 arrest is normally
induced in p53-deficient cancers, suggesting that some p53-independent
mechanisms are sufficient for G2 checkpoint functioning. Recent studies
showed that p53-deficient cells rely on ATM- and ATR-mediated checkpoint
signaling through the p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase/MAP
kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) pathway for survival after
DNA damage.
94
Evidence has shown that p53-mediated
apoptosis or cell cycle arrest is modulated by ATM and CHK2 activities.
95
In cells and tumors that lacked a functional
p53 pathway, inactivation of ATM or its downstream molecule CHK2 was
sufficient to globally sensitize the cells to genotoxic chemotherapy
with cisplatin or doxorubicin.
95
In contrast,
in p53 wild-type cells, the inhibition of ATM or CHK2 resulted in
a substantial survival benefit, suggesting that a combination of cisplatin
and doxorubicin with inhibitors of ATM and CHK2 could benefit patients
with p53 mutant tumors. Genome-wide small hairpin RNA screening also
revealed that inhibiting ATM or MET induced synthetic lethality with
a p53 stabilizing/activating compound nutlin-3 (
10
) (Figure
​
(Figure5)
5
) and converted the cellular response from cell
cycle arrest to apoptosis in various cancer cell types without affecting
the expression of key p53 target genes.
96
Although ATM inhibitors such as CP466722 (
11
) and KU59403
(
12
) do not have single-agent activity in cancer cell
lines, they could sensitize cancer cells to ionizing radiation and/or
genotoxic chemotherapeutics.

Checkpoint
pathways and cell cycle regulations. DNA damage caused
by physical, chemical, and biological factors, such as oncogene activation,
activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase related kinases ATM and ATR,
leading to the activation of CHK2, CHK1, and p38/MK2, which further
regulate activity and stability of cell cycle regulators, including
p53 and CDC25. p53/p21 is the major regulator of G1/S checkpoint.
The loss of p53 function in cancer cells makes the cells addicting
to the S and/or G2/M checkpoints for DNA repaire and survival. Inhibiting
S and/or G2/M checkpoint regulators may induce synthetic lethality
in p53 mutant cells when DNA is damaged. Arrow indicates activation,
and the line terminating with a black circle indicates suppression.

Figure 5
Structures of nutlin-3 and inhibitors of ATM/ATR.
Similar results have shown that
inhibiting ATR and CHK1 exacerbates
levels of oncogene-induced replicative stress, promoting the cell
killing of oncogene-overexpressing cells and sensitizing tumor cells
to DNA-damaging therapy. Inhibiting ATR by a dominant negative construct
selectively sensitizes G1 checkpoint-deficient cells to DNA damage-induced
lethal premature chromatin condensation.
98
Knockdown of ATR expression selectively enhanced cisplatin sensitivity
in human colorectal cancer cells with inactivated p53, whereas the
restoration of p53 in ATR-deficient cells increased cell survival
after cisplatin treatment.
99
Reduced ATR
expression prevented the development of Myc-induced lymphomas or pancreatic
tumors in mice by enhancing Myc-induced replicative stress and apoptosis,
which is more pronounced in p53-deficient cells.
100
Transgenic mice with diminished ATR function in the skin
have increased apoptosis after ultraviolet exposure and reduced ultraviolet-induced
skin carcinogenesis, suggesting that the inhibition of the replication
checkpoint function may have therapeutic and/or preventive benefits.
101
Inhibiting ATR also induced synthetic lethality
in XRCC1-deficient cancer cells
102
and
sensitized cancer cells to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents.
103
Synthetic lethality in XRCC1-deficient cancer
cells is also elicited by the ATM inhibitor KU55933 (
13
) and the DNA-PK inhibitor NU7441 (
14
).
104
A cell-based screening of 623 PI3K inhibitors
led researchers to
identify an mTOR- and ATR-selective inhibitor, ETP-46464 (
15
), that induces replicative stress and synthetic lethality in p53-deficient
or cyclin E-overexpressing cells.
105
The
IC
50
values of
15
for mTOR and ATR are 0.6
and 14 nM, respectively, but >36 nM for DNAPK, PI3K, and ATM. AZ20
(
16
), an ATR inhibitor derived from the mTOR inhibitor
sulfonylmorpholinopyrimidine, was reported to have single-agent
activity when administered orally in mice bearing the xenograft established
from colon cancer cell line LoVo.
106
Through
high-throughput screening and compound optimization, Charrier et al.
developed an ATR-selective inhibitor, VE-821 (
17
), with
IC
50
values for ATR, ATM, and DNAPK of 12 nM, >8 μM,
and >8 μM, respectively.
107
In
vitro
study revealed that treatment with
17
alone induced selective
killing of ATM- or p53-deficient cancer cells but only reversibly
limited cell cycle progression in normal cells.
17
also
increased cisplatin potency 10-fold in HCT116 cells, suggesting that
inhibiting ATR could potentiate the efficacies of radiotherapy and
genotoxic drugs.
108
VE-822 (
18
), an analogue of
17
, was found to have in vivo activity
in blocking ATR and sensitizing pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine-based
chemoradiation therapy.
109
Nevertheless,
no clinical studies with ATM or ATR inhibitors have yet been reported.
In comparison to the development of ATM/ATR inhibitors, the development
of CHK inhibitors, specifically CHK1 inhibitors, is more advanced
possibly because it is easier to perform enzymatic analysis on CHK1/CHK2.
CHK1 and CHK2 have a highly conserved kinase domain but have distinct
overall protein structures.
110
However,
several small molecular inhibitors inhibit both CHK1 and CHK2 with
a similar potency. In an Eμ-Myc-driving lymphoma model, inhibiting
CHK1, CHK2, or both with small molecule inhibitors induced cell death,
although the Eμ-Myc p53 null lymphoma cells were more sensitive
to a dual CHK1/CHK2 inhibitor than to a CHK1-specific inhibitor.
111
AZD7762 (

) (Figure

(Figure6),

), a dual CHK1/2 inhibitor, also enhances radiosensitivity-
and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in p53 mutant and/or p21-deficient
tumor cells to a greater extent than in p53 wild-type tumor cells.

,
113
The potentiation of DNA damaging agent-induced apoptosis by CHK
inhibitors is possibly caused by abrogation of the G2 checkpoint and/or
inhibition of HR DNA repair.

Structures
of CHK1/2 inhibitors.
Gene knockout studies revealed that knockout of CHK1 or CHK2
caused
defects in the induction and/or maintenance of irradiation-induced
G2 arrest.
115
,
116
Intriguingly, knockout of ATM
or CHK2 is viable for cells and animals, although phenotypes of ataxia
telangiectasia, chromosomal abnormality, and the development of thymic
lymphomas are observed in ATM knockout,
117
whereas resistance to ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis is observed
in CHK2 knockout.
115
,
118
In contrast, knockout of ATR
or CHK1 is lethal for cells and embryos with defects in the G2/M DNA
damage checkpoint,
116
,
119
indicating that the ATR/CHK1
pathway is essential for cell survival. Therefore, inhibitors of ATR
and/or CHK1 could be more potent and toxic than those of ATM and/or
CHK2. A synthetic lethality siRNA screening of 572 kinases for improving
gemcitabine or cisplatin response in pancreatic or ovarian cancer
cells revealed the greatest potentiation by siRNA targeting of ATR
and/or CHK1.
120
Similar results were obtained
by inhibiting CHK1 with small molecule inhibitors such as PD407824
(a dual inhibitor of CHK1 and Wee1) (
20
).
120
A phase I study on
19
single-agent
therapy and combination
therapy with gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumors showed
that the dose-limiting toxicities are cardiac and liver function abnormalities
and myelosuppression. No objective responses were observed, although
disease stabilization was observed in some patients.
121
UCN-01 (7-hydroxystaurosporin) (
21
), a protein
kinase C inhibitor that also inhibits many other kinases, including
CHK1, and abrogates the G2 checkpoint has been reported to enhance
the effectiveness of genotoxic agents in p53-deficient cells.
122
A phase I study of
21
in combination
with perifosine or irinotecan showed some partial response in p53-defective
triple-negative breast cancer,
123
whereas
a phase II trial in metastatic melanoma showed that
21
as a single agent is not active in refractory melanoma.
124
Both
19
and
21
have
been found to be not favorable for further development because of
pharmacokinetic and toxicity issues. MK-8776 (SCH900776) (
22
) and LY2603618 (
23
) are CHK1 selective inhibitors (50-
to 500-fold more active than on CHK2)
125
,
126
that are
being used in clinical trials for the treatment of leukemias and solid
tumors. Cardiac toxicity and myelosuppression were observed in phase
I trials of both
22
and
23
in combination
therapy with cytarabine and pemetrexed, respectively.
127

was used in combination with cytarabine to treat
refractory acute leukemias. Complete remissions occurred in 8 (33%)

129
Some CHK2-selective inhibitors have been identified, including PV1019
(
24
)
130
and CCT241533 (
25
).
131
Both agents were reported
to be highly selective against CHK1 and have radioprotective effects
in mouse thymocytes.
130
,
131
As single agents, both
24
and
25
had mild antitumor activity but were
found to potentiate the cytotoxicity of genotoxic agents and PARP
inhibitors, respectively.
130
However, clinical
evaluation is not available for these agents.Oncogenic RAS and Anti-RAS
Therapeutics
Activating mutations in three oncogenic
RAS
genes
(
H-
,
N-
, and
K
-
RAS
) is among the first and the most common genetic alterations
identified in human cancers, occurring in approximately 30% of human
tumors.
132
The
KRAS
gene
encodes two splicing isoforms, a major KRAS 4B and a minor KRAS 4A.
Therefore, mammals have four small (21 kDa) oncogenic Ras proteins
of about 190 amino acids in size, with the first 165 aa conserved
in the N-terminal for all the RAS proteins. The KRAS 4B, HRAS, and
NRAS isoforms are ubiquitously expressed, whereas KRAS 4A is expressed
mainly in kidney, liver, and gastrointestinal tissues.
133
As a subfamily of small guanine nucleotide-binding
proteins, RAS proteins cycle between an active guanosine triphosphate
(GTP) bound form and an inactive guanosine diphosphate (GDP) bound
form.
134
Binding of RAS with GTP is facilitated
by guanine nucleotide exchange factors through catalyzing the release
of GDP and is required for the interaction of RAS with target proteins.
The intrinsic GTPase activity that is enhanced by GTPase-activating
proteins converts GTP to GDP, leading to a GDP-bound, inactive RAS.
RAS
mutations that diminish the GTPase activity or decrease
the GDP binding capacity render RAS in a constitutively active, GTP-bound
status. In the absence of a
RAS
mutation, increased
Ras activity is frequently detected in human cancer because of gene
amplification,
135
overexpression,
136
an increase in upstream signals from tyrosine-kinase
growth-factor receptors such as HER2 and EGFR,
137
and altered expression of micro-RNA such as let-7.
138
Increased RAS activity is associated with resistance
to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, leading to a poor prognosis.
139
,
140
As a key mediator in the signaling transduction for a variety
of
growth factors, cytokines, and hormones, RAS proteins are transferred
to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, where they interact with
a diversity of membrane receptors and execute signal transduction
in a variety of signaling pathways that govern cell growth, proliferation,
differentiation, and death. Several steps of posttranslational modifications
are critical for trafficking RAS proteins to the plasma membrane,
including farnesylation at the cysteine residue of the carboxy-terminal
CAAX motif and methylation of farnesyl cysteine at the C-terminal.
141
The enzymes involved in these processes, such
as farnesyltransferase,
142
geranylgeranyltransferase,
143
and isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase,
144
have been intensively investigated in preclinical
and clinical trials for anti-RAS therapy. Small molecules binding
irreversibly to the KRAS (G12C) mutant protein
145
or interfering with Ras–effector protein interaction
146
have recently been reported. Targeting the
Ras downstream pathways, particularly the RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathways,
147
has also been investigated
for inhibiting
Ras
mutant cancer cells. A clinical
trial with biomarker-integrated targeted therapy for lung cancer has
revealed that sorafenib (
26
), a pan-RAF and VEGFR inhibitor,
has impressive benefits for
KRAS
mutant patients.
148
However, selective inhibition of BRAF with
a dominant negative construct
149
in mice
or with BRAF-selective inhibitors such as vemurafenib (
27
) in patients
150
promoted the development
and/or progression of
RAS
mutant cancers possibly
because of the activation of other RAF isoforms, such as RAF-1. Thus
far, effective anti-RAS therapeutics is not clinically available.
Indirect anti-Ras therapy with the synthetic lethality-based approach
has recently been investigated by several groups. It is noteworthy
that expression of oncogenic
RAS
in primary normal
human or rodent cells often results in apoptosis or senescence, whereas
expression of oncogenic
RAS
in immortal cells or
cells with inactivation of p53, p16, or the transcriptional activator
interferon regulatory factor 1 leads to transformation and tumorigenesis,
151
−
153
suggesting that
RAS
transformed cells have additional
signaling context for survival, which provides opportunity of synthetic
lethality based anti-RAS therapy. In fact, RAS pathways interact with
many other cancer related pathways. Several studies on siRNA library
screens with isogenic cell lines harboring mutant and wild-type
RAS
genes have revealed synthetic lethal interactions of
oncogenic
RAS
with some key nodes in cancer signaling
network, including Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a serine/threonine protein
kinase that regulates cell mitosis;
10
the
transcription factor Wilms tumor 1 (WT1);
154
TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a noncanonical IκB kinase that
regulates the stability of IκB;
9
spleen
tyrosine kinase (SYK);
155
and CDK4
11
(Figure
​
(Figure7).
7
). Some small-molecule
inhibitors of PLK1, CDK4, and SYK are already being used in clinical
trials for anticancer therapy.
156
,
157
The synthetic lethality
interactions of those targets with oncogenic
RAS
suggest
that
RAS
gene mutation might be used as a marker
to identify responders.

Ras signaling pathways and synthetic lethal
interactions. Receptor
tyrosine kinases (RTK) activate RAS and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. RAS
in turn activates RAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and RalGEF/Ral pathways
and crosstalks with RTK, WNT, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), reactive
oxidative species (ROS), STAT3, and tumor necrosis factor α
(TNFα)/NFκB pathways. Several key nodes in those signaling
networks, such as TBK1, PLK1, CDK4, SYK, and WT1 (colored tan), have
been reported to have synthetic lethal interactions with oncogenic
RAS. In contrast, activation of p53 and JNK may lead to apoptosis.

Several innovative anticancer agents that selectively induce
cytotoxic
effects in cancer cells with
RAS
mutations have been
identified by screening chemical libraries, including triphenyltetrazolium
(
28
) and a sulfinyl cytidine derivative (
29
) (Figure
​
(Figure8)

) that demonstrated approximately
6-fold selectivity for cell lines containing mutant
KRAS

erastin (

exhibited lethal selectivity in human tumor cells harboring mutations
in the
HRAS
,

BRAF
oncogenes by acting on mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels
and inducing oxidative cell death;

lanperisone

and oncrasin-1 (

Interestingly,
30
,
160
31

159
and analogues of
32
(
161

162
) all induced cell-killing effects in
RAS
mutant
tumor cells by triggering oxidative stress, although through different
underlying mechanisms. While
30
may act on mitochondrial
voltage-dependent anion channels and induce oxidative cell death,
160
32
and its analogues act on RNA
polymerase II, protein kinase Cι (PKCι), and STAT3.
8
,
163
,
164
Most of the molecules involved
in oncrasin-induced antitumor activity are directly involved either
in signal transductions in RAS, MYC, and STAT3 pathways or in causing
synthetic lethality in cells with elevated activity of
RAS
or
MYC
oncogenes.

Structures of oncogenic Ras synthetic
lethal agents.
Similar to the agents
identified through other approaches, substantial
efforts will be required for optimization of compounds identified
through synthetic lethality screening. Effort has been made in the
Developmental Therapeutics Program at the National Cancer Institute
and in our own laboratory for compound optimization of oncrasin 1.
One of the most active analogue compounds, NSC-743380 (
33
), was tested in vitro with the
NCI-60 cell panel and 50 non-small-cell lung carcinoma cell lines
and was highly active (IC
50
between 10 nM and 1 μM)
in 30 of 102 cancer cell lines tested.
164
,
165
In 50 non-small-cell
lung cancer cell lines tested, 16 (32%) were highly responsive to
this compound (IC
50
< 0.33 μM), including many
KRAS
mutant cancer cell lines,
8
,
165
suggesting
that a large subset of cancer patients may potentially benefit from
treatment with this agent. In vivo studies performed in our laboratory
and by the National Cancer Institute’s Developmental Therapeutics
Program have shown that intraperitoneal administration of
33
at doses of 67–150 mg/kg caused complete tumor regression
or significant growth suppression in some xenograft tumor models,
164
,
165
suggesting that this compound has the potential to move to further
development. Nevertheless, most compounds developed by synthetic lethality
screening for oncogenic
RAS
are still at the preclinical
evaluation stage.Future Prospects
The enthusiasm
for developing synthetic lethality based anticancer
therapeutics has been increasing recently, with increasing numbers
of publications on this topic. Most potential therapeutic targets
or therapeutic agents developed through the concept of synthetic lethality
are identified by cell-based screening with pairs of isogenic cell
lines. Although this approach may facilitate development of genotype-specific
anticancer therapeutics, several studies have demonstrated that synthetic
lethality is likely cell context dependent. For example,
KRAS
mutant cancer cell lines have been characterized as either
KRAS
-dependent or
KRAS
-independent, on
the basis of cell-killing effects induced by knockdown of the
KRAS
gene itself.
155
When 45
genes that have synthetic lethality with EGFR inhibitors in the cervical
adenocarcinoma cell line A431 were tested for sensitization to erlotinib
or cetuximab in seven other cell lines, none of the genes sensitized
all tested cell lines, although several of the genes sensitized three
to five of the cell lines.
12
Similarly,
resistance to the synthetic lethality of PARP inhibitors in
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
mutant cancers has been
observed both in experimental tumor models and in clinical trials.
166
The differences in genetic and/or epigenetic
backgrounds in individual cells may explain the cell-context-dependent
synthetic lethality observed in various studies. Because a tumor may
harbor an average of 30–70 mutated genes,
1
an individual primary tumor or established cancer cell
line may carry multiple concomitantly activated oncogenes or inactivated
tumor suppressor genes. The activation in other signaling pathways
may provide redundant input that drives and maintains downstream survival
signaling, resulting in resistance to therapeutic agents that target
a particular genetic lesion either directly or indirectly through
synthetic lethality. Moreover, even though some passenger mutations
in tumor cells may not contribute to tumorigenesis, these mutations
may affect drug response because of altered drug metabolism or drug
efflux. As a result, querying for the synthetic lethality partners
of an oncogenic
KRAS
gene can identify different
candidate genes or lead compounds in different cell lines.
9
,
10
,
154
Similarly, a synthetic lethality
gene–agent combination identified in one cell line may not
necessarily be applicable to another cell line.
12
Mechanistic delineation of molecules or pathways that mediate
responses to synthetic lethality anticancer therapeutics and the identification
of predictive biomarkers for treatment responses will be critical
for the successful development of synthetic lethality anticancer therapeutics.
On the other hand, the concept of synthetic lethality has also been
explored for characterizing mechanisms of resistance and for combination
therapy or multimodality therapy to enhance the efficacy of anticancer
drugs.
12
−
14
Simultaneous targeting the redundant survival pathways
is expected to overcome resistance and/or enhance efficacy in anticancer
therapy. However, toxicity may increase as well.
Our own experience
in developing synthetic-lethality-based anticancer
therapeutics suggests that mechanistic characterization
163
,
167
and compound optimization
164
,
168
could be challenging
and time-consuming. The biological functions of compounds identified
through cell-based synthetic lethality screening are largely unknown.
Technological developments in chemical biology, such as conjugating
compounds to biotin or resin beads and performing affinity-based target
precipitation and subsequent protein identification by mass spectrometry
analysis, may facilitate target and mechanistic characterization.
However, conjugating and immobilizing a small compound may change
its biological function and protein-binding specificity. Alternatively,
target proteins may be enriched by protecting the targets from protease-mediated
degradation through the binding of unmodified compounds to their targets.
The results may depend on the efficiency and specificity of the protection.
Robust efforts on in vivo optimization of the lead compound are also
essential in drug development, as compounds with similar chemical
structures and in vitro activity may have dramatically different in
vivo toxicity and efficacy profiles.Acknowledgments
