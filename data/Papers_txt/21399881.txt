Abstract. Genetically engineered mice with targeted alterations
in clinically relevant oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes or
DNA mismatch repair genes provide unique predictive animal
models for human carcinogenesis, and cancer prevention/
therapy. However, some of the genetically engineered mouse
models lack target organ specificity for colon carcinogenesis.
We have established, characterized and validated stable epithelial
cell lines from ‘normal’ and ‘genetically’ predisposed
target organs that offer innovative and mechanistic approaches,
complementing in vivo studies on existing animal models for
clinical breast and colon cancer. Epithelial cell lines with upregulated
Ras or myc oncogene, mutated Apc tumor suppressor
gene and Mlh1 DNA mismatch repair gene provide facile
experimental systems for organ site carcinogenesis and cancer
prevention. Altered expression of cancer specific biomarkers
and their modulation by several synthetic pharmacological
agents such as retinoids, selective estrogen receptor modulators,
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and specific enzyme
inhibitors have been reported from our laboratory. Oncogene
expressing MMEC-Ras and MMEC-myc mammary epithelial
cells, Apc mutant 850Min COL and 1638N COL, and DNA
mismatch repair/Apc mutant Mlh1/1638N COL colon epithelial
cells exhibit aberrant cell cycle progression, down-regulated
apoptosis and enhanced carcinogenic risk in vitro and tumor
formation in vivo. We have reported that relative to the parental
‘normal’ non-neoplastic cells, genetically ‘altered’ pre-neoplastic
cells exhibit enhanced sensitivity for growth arrest by multiple
mechanistically distinct pharmacological agents. Comparative
experiments on isogenic ‘normal’ and genetically ‘altered’ target
cell lines facilitate cancer selective efficacy and identification
of susceptible mechanistic pathways. Treatment of these
genetically ‘altered’ pre-neoplastic cells with low dose combination
of mechanistically distinct pharmacological agents as
well as naturally occurring phytochemicals induce cytostatic
growth arrest, alter cell cycle progression and reduce carcinogenic
risk. The availability of validated technology for model
development, and for mechanism based biomarker assays now
establishes a novel platform to rapidly test carcinogenicity and
preventive/therapeutic efficacy of novel pharmacological agents
as well as naturally occurring phytochemicals. Thus, these data
permit rational prioritization of efficacious lead compounds
for preclinical testing and future clinical trials for prevention/
therapy of breast and colon cancer.

1. Introduction

Breast and colon cancer together represent prevalent cause
of mortality in the US population. Recent estimates by the
American Cancer Society have projected 192,370 new cases
of breast cancer and 106,100 new cases of colon cancer in 2009
(1). This survey has also projected 40,170 breast cancer related
deaths and 49,920 colon cancer related deaths. The life time risk
for breast and colon cancer is thus estimated to be 1 in 8 and 1
in 19, respectively. These actuarial data emphasize a persistent
need for identifying specific and sensitive biomarkers for
carcinogenic risk, and also for safe and effective interventional
modalities.
Several elegant observations have provided scientifically
robust support to the concept that gain of function mutations
in oncogenes and loss of function mutations in the tumor
suppressor genes represent primary predisposing genetic
defects in breast and colon cancer (2-8). In accord, several
genetically engineered mouse models have been developed
and characterized to represent well established predictive
pre-clinical animal models for clinical breast and colon cancer
(5-8).

Conventional treatment options for breast and colon cancer
continue to be chemo-endocrine therapy for breast and chemotherapy
for colon. However, conventional long-term therapeutic
interventional modalities are frequently associated with acquired
tumor resistance and adverse systemic toxicity, compromising
patient compliance (9-14).
Genetically engineered mouse models have also been
extensively used as mechanism based screens to identify
novel preventive/therapeutic interventional modalities (15,16).
However, the genetically engineered mouse models for familial
adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and hereditary non-polyposis
colon cancer (HNPCC) syndromes that express germ line
mutations in clinically relevant tumor suppressor gene and/or
DNA mismatch repair genes exhibit carcinogenesis predominantly
in the small intestine, rather than in the colon (4,6-8),
while clinical FAP and HNPCC syndromes represent high risk
lesions for colon cancer (3,4). Thus, these in vivo approaches
are frequently associated with conceptual and technical limitations
related to clinical translatability of the generated data.
Cell culture models developed from target tissue for organ
site cancer that express clinically relevant genetic defects and
exhibit quantifiable risk for carcinogenesis, thus represent an
alternative approach that complements existing animal models
for rapid mechanism based prioritization of efficacious preventive/
therapeutic agents.
In the progressive pathogenesis of organ site cancer of breast
and colon, intra-epithelial neoplasia such as ductal carcinoma
in situ (DCIS) of the breast and adenoma of the colon have been
considered as definitive pre-invasive lesions at risk for invasive
cancer (2-4,17).
At the molecular level, DCIS are characterized by the
presence or absence of hormone receptors and over expression/
mutation of select genes such as Ras, myc, HER-2 and p53,
and therefore, exhibit variable response to chemo-endocrine
therapy (2,17,18). The colonic adenomas are characterized by
germ line or somatic mutations in tumor suppressor adenomatous
polyposis coli (APC) gene or in select DNA mismatch
repair genes that are associated with high risk familial adenomatous
polyposis (FAP) or hereditary non-polyposis cancer
(HNPCC) syndromes, respectively (3,4).
Chemoprevention of these epithelial organ site cancers of
breast and colon, using synthetic pharmacological agents or

naturally occurring compounds individually or in combination
to inhibit, reduce or delay the multi-step carcinogenic process
has attracted intense clinical interest. Thus, the ability of chemopreventive
agents at low non-toxic levels to target early occurring
carcinogenic events represents a major promise of current clinical
preventive intervention (18,19).
The present review summarizes the data generated from our
experiments designed to i) develop cell culture models from
genetically engineered mice predisposed to breast and colon
cancer, ii) identify specific and sensitive surrogate endpoint
biomarkers for loss of homeostatic growth control and gain of
carcinogenic risk, and iii) validate the developed cell culture
based approaches as rapid screens for efficacious preventive/
therapeutic agents.

2. Preclinical cell culture models for genetically predisposed
breast and colon cancer

Breast. Aberrant expression of select oncogenes such as Ras,
myc or HER-2 has been detected in several clinical organ site
cancers including breast cancer (2,17-19). Similarly, targeted
expression of these individual oncogenes in genetically
engineered mice is associated with mammary carcinogenesis
(5,15-17), and more importantly, stable transfection of these
oncogenes in non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells is
sufficient to induce multi-step tumorigenic transformation
(20-22). With an objective of developing a cell culture model for
oncogene-induced mammary carcinogenesis, we established
stable transfectants from immortalized non-tumorigenic mouse
mammary epithelial cells (MMEC) that were transfected
independently with EJ-Ras and c-myc oncogenes and characterized
the resultant MMEC-Ras and MMEC-myc cell lines
(20,21).

Colon. Germ line mutations in the APC tumor suppressor gene
represent a primary genetic defect in the FAP syndrome (3,4),
while those in select DNA mismatch repair genes such as
Mlh1 represent a primary genetic defect in the HNPCC
syndrome (4). Both these syndromes are associated with genetic
predisposition for early onset familial/hereditary colon cancer
(15,16). Genetically engineered mice carrying Apc and/or Apc
plus DNA mismatch gene mutations exhibit high risk for

intestinal cancer (6-8,15,16). In an effort to develop preclinical
in vitro colon epithelial cell culture models for FAP and HNPCC
syndromes, we used histopathologically normal descending
colon (a target organ site for colon cancer) from Apc mutant
Apc850Min/+, Apc 1638N [+/-], and Mlh1 [+/-]/1638N [+/-] mice to
establish and characterize 850Min COL, 1638N COL and Mlh1/
1638N COL cell lines, respectively (23-26).

3. Biomarkers for carcinogenic risk

Loss of homeostatic growth control and gain of carcinogenic
risk together characterize the pre-neoplastically transformed
cells. Population doubling time, and status of proliferative and
apoptotic cell populations represent the end point biomarkers
for homeostatic growth control, while anchorage-independent

growth and tumorigenecity represent the end point biomarker
for carcinogenic risk.

Breast. The data generated from the experiments on mamary
epithelial cells MMEC, MMEC-Ras and MMEC-myc are
summarized in Table I. These data demonstrate that oncogene
transfected cell lines exhibit 23.7-31.7% decrease in the
population doubling time, relative to the parental MMEC cells.
Furthermore, these transfected cells also exhibit 4.0- to
4.4- fold increase in the ratio of proliferative (S+G2/M) versus
apoptotic (subG0) cell population due to increased proliferation
and decreased cellular apoptosis. These data provided evidence
that aberrant proliferation and down-regulated apoptosis
lead to the loss of homeostatic growth control in oncogene
transfected mammary epithelial MMEC-Ras and MMEC-myc
cells.
The Ras and myc oncogene transfected cells exhibit 53.4-
to 55.0-fold increase in the number of anchorage-independent
(AI) colonies and greater than 90% incidence of tumors, 3-5
weeks post-transplantation. In contrast, the parental MMEC
cells lack anchorage-independent colony formation and
tumorigenicity. These data are consistent with several previous
publications (20-22) and provide evidence for gain of carcinogenic
risk in the oncogene transfected mammary epithelial
cells.

Colon. The data generated in the cell lines C57 COL (Apc [+/+]/
Mlh1 [+/+]), 850Min COL, 1638N COL (Apc [+/-], FAP models),
and Mlh1 COL and Mlh1/1638N COL (Mlh1
[+/-], Apc [+/-],
HNPCC model) are summarized in Table II. The cell culture
models for FAP syndrome exhibit 50 to 65% decrease in the
population doubling time and 4.2- to 12.7-fold increase in the
S+G2/M: subG0 ratio due to aberrant proliferation and downregulated
apoptosis. In the cell culture model for the HNPCC
syndrome these end points exhibit 41.2% decrease and 94.7%
increase, respectively. It was noteworthy that in contrast to the
double mutant Mlh1/1638N COL cells, the Mlh1 COL cells
containing only the Mlh1 mutation failed to express these
perturbed biomarkers that are specific for the loss of homeostatic
growth control.

The anchorage-independent colony formation representing
the surrogate end point biomarker for carcinogenic risk
exhibited 19.7-31.1-fold increase in the number of AI colonies
in the FAP models and 16.1-fold increase in the HNPCC model.
The Mlh1 COL cells did not exhibit anchorage-independent
colony formation. The models for FAP and HNPCC syndromes
also exhibited 80-100% incidence of tumors after a latent period
of 8-14 weeks post-transplantation. In contrast, the normal
C57 COL cells and Mlh1 mutant Mlh1 COL cells lacked the
expression of the biomarker specific for carcinogenic risk. These
data on Mlh1 COL cells suggest that mutation in DNA repair
gene alone is not sufficient to increase the carcinogenic risk.
These data taken together indicate that mutations in Apc
alone or in both Apc and Mlh1 genes together represent primary
genetic defects that are responsible for induction of aberrant
proliferation and for predisposition for enhanced carcinogenic
risk in the present cell culture models of FAP and HNPCC
syndromes, respectively. In contrast, mutation in the Mlh1 gene
alone may be insufficient to drive the carcinogenic process. It is
noteworthy that mutations and/or other genetic defects in
APC together with MLH1 genes have been observed in clinical
HNPCC (3,4,15,16).

4. Chemopreventive test compounds

Our previous publications have reported preventive efficacy of
several mechanistically distinct pharmacological agents and
naturally occurring phytochemicals on developed cell culture
model for ER-
/PR-
/HER-2+
 comedo DCIS that is at risk for
developing chemo-endocrine therapy resistant breast cancer
(27-30), and on cell culture models for FAP syndrome (23-25)
and HNPCC syndrome (26). These test compounds used individually
at pharmacologically achievable dose levels, inhibit cell
cycle progression, induce cellular apoptosis and reduce carcinogenic
risk in all the cell culture models. It is noteworthy that
the chemopreventive test compounds selected for present
studies have documented evidence of efficacy both as single
agents, as well as low dose combinations in the animal model
systems and in clinical setting (31-36).

Breast. The experiments designed to examine the growth
inhibitory effects of selected chemo-preventive test compounds
on the ER+
 Ras and myc oncogene transfected mammary

epithelial cell culture models are summarized in Table III.
Clinically relevant synthetic retinoid N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)
retinamide (4-HPR) and selective estrogen receptor modulator
Tamoxifen (TAM) were selected as the test compounds for
the experiments with mammary epithelial cell lines.
The synthetic retinoid 4-HPR functions as a potent inhibitor
of reactive oxygen species and has documented efficacy against
breast cancers irrespective of their hormone receptor status
(31). The selective estrogen receptor modulator TAM has
documented selective efficacy against estrogen receptor positive
breast cancer (9). It was noteworthy that the oncogene transfected
cells exhibited 63-94% greater sensitivity to growth
inhibition relative to that exhibited by the parental cells
(Table III).

Colon. Clinically relevant non-steriodal anti-inflammatory
drug Sulindac (SUL) and selective orinithine decarboxylase
inhibitor Difluoro methylornithine (DFMO) were selected as
the test compounds for the experiments with the colon epithelial
cell lines (Table III).
The synthetic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, sulindac
(SUL), functions as a pan-selective cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor,

and has documented efficacy in the FAP syndrome, as well as
in sporadic colon cancer (32). The synthetic pharmacological
agent difluoro-methylornitine (DFMO) functions as selective
inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, a critical rate limiting
enzyme in polyamine bio-synthetic pathway (33). Cyclooxygenase
and ornithine decarboxylase enzymes are up-regulated
in colon cancer and therefore, represent important molecular
targets for preventive/therapeutic interventions (18,19,32,33).
The colon epithelial cell lines exhibiting genetic defects in
Apc alone or in Apc and Mlh1 represent relevant cell culture
models for the FAP and HNPCC syndromes, respectively.
These models exhibited 49.1-80.5% greater sensitivity to the
test compounds relative to that observed in the C57 COL cell
line. In this context, it was noteworthy that consistent with
a lack of carcinogenic risk, Mlh1 COL cells that have
mutation only in the Mlh1 DNA mismatch repair gene were
substantially less sensitive to the inhibitory effects of the test
compounds, than were the models for FAP and HNPCC
syndromes.

5. Combinatorial preventive efficacy

Several recent reports have demonstrated that low-dose combinations
of mechanistically distinct chemo-preventive agents
exhibit enhanced efficacy relative to that produced by individual
agents at comparative concentrations (34-36).

Breast. To examine the concept of combinatorial preventive
efficacy in the developed mammary epithelial cell culture
models, low dose combinations of 4-HPR+TAM were used on
the oncogene transfected MMEC-Ras and MMEC-myc cells.
The efficacy of the combinations was monitored by the status
of G1: S+G2/M ratio (specific for aberrant proliferation) and
anchorage independent colony formation (specific for
carcinogenic risk).
The data generated from the experiments designed to
examine the effect of low dose combination of 4-HPR+TAM
on G1: S+G2/M ratio in MMEC-Ras and MMEC-Myc cells are
presented in Table IV. These data demonstrate that in MMECRas
cells the 4-HPR+TAM combination is about 3.5-fold and
30% more efficacious in increasing the G1: S+G2/M ratio
relative to that observed by 4-HPR or TAM individually at
equimolar concentrations. Similarly, the experiment on MMECMyc
cells revealed a 1.2-fold and 60.5% greater efficacy of the
combination relative to individual agents.

The data from the experiments designed to examine the
effect of the 4-HPR+TAM combination on anchorage-independent
colony formation in two oncogene transfected cell lines
are presented in Fig. 1A and B. The AI colony number In
MMEC-Ras cells treated with 4-HPR, TAM and 4-HPR+TAM
was 19.0±2.8, 16.3±2.4 and 4.0±0.6, respectively. Thus, in these
cells the combination exhibits about 77% greater efficacy in
reduction of AI colonies relative to that observed by these
agents individually at equimolar concentrations. The AI colony
number in MMEC-Myc cells treated with 4-HPR, TAM and
4-HPR+TAM was 17.4±1.2, 14.6±1.0 and 8.9±0.6, respectively.
These data indicated that 4-HPR+TAM combination exhibits
about 44% greater efficacy relative to these agents individually.

Colon. To examine the concept of combinatorial preventive
efficacy in the FAP and HNPCC models low-dose combination
of SUL+DFMO were utilized. The data generated from
experiments to examine the modulation in G1: S+G2/M ratio
by the low dose combination of SUL+DFMO are presented in
Table V. In 850Min COL cells the combination of SUL+DFMO
exhibit 1.4-fold and 56.1% greater efficacy to increase the
G1:S+G2/M ratio relative to that observed by these agents
individually. In 1638N COL cells the combination exhibits
45.7% and 59.4% greater efficacy, while in Mlh1/1638N COL
cells the combination exhibits 1.7-fold and 41.2% greater
efficacy.
The data from experiments designed to examine the effect
of the SUL+DFMO combination on anchorage-independent
colony formation in the three colon epithelial cell lines are
presented in Fig. 2A-C. In 850Min COL cells the AI colony
number in SUL, DFMO and SUL+DFMO treated groups was
14.4±2.4, 13.5±2.2 and 8.4±1.4, respectively. These data indicate
that the combination exhibits about 39.7% greater efficacy in
reduction of AI colonies. In 1638N COL cells the AI colony
number SUL, DFMO and SUL+DFMO treated groups was
15.7±2.0, 14.2±1.8 and 9.8±1.3, while that in Mlh1/1638N COL
cells was 10.9±1.3, 8.9±1.1 and 6.0±0.7, respectively. Collectively,
these data indicated that in the two cell lines the SUL+DFMO
combination exhibits 41.2% and 38.7% greater efficacy
respectively relative to these agents individually.

1200 telang and Katdare: Genetically altered breast and colon cells for cancer

cancer. Target tissue derived epithelial cell lines expressing
clinically relevant genetic defects and exhibiting quantifiable
risk for carcinogenesis promise to provide facile experimental
approaches that complement the existing animal models.

The data presented for mammary epithelial cell culture
models demonstrate that targeted expression of Ras and Myc
oncogenes drives the multi-step carcinogenic process by
inducing aberrant cell cycle progression, down-regulated
cellular apoptosis and anchorage-independent growth in vitro
prior to tumor development in vivo. These modulations taken
together provide evidence for oncogene mediated loss of homeostatic
growth control and gain of carcinogenic risk. Essentially
similar modulations in these surrogate end point biomarkers
for carcinogenic risk have also been observed in the colonic
epithelial cells exhibiting germ line mutations in the tumor
suppressor Apc gene and/or in Apc plus DNA mismatch repair
genes. The present biological characterization of the newly
developed cell culture models now sets the stage for their
molecular characterization relevant to the status of Ras, Myc,
Apc signaling cascades and DNA repair pathways.
The experiments on the growth inhibitory effects of prototypical
chemopreventive test compounds have provided
evidence that preneoplastically transformed cells are more
sensitive to growth inhibition than the isogenic parental nontransformed
cells. The selectivity for chemopreventive efficacy
validates these isogenic models as a unique approach for
evaluation of mechanistic efficacy of new compounds.
Clinically relevant, mechanistically distinct 4-HPR and
TAM for mammary epithelial cell culture models, and SUL
and DFMO for colon epithelial cell culture models validate
the clinical relevance of the present experimental approach,
since these agents have documented preventive/therapeutic
efficacy as single agents for clinical breast and colon cancer,
respectively (9,12,13,18,19,31-33). Enhanced efficacy of these
test compounds at low-dose combinations essentially extends
and confirms similar efficacy observed in vivo in the genetically
engineered mouse models (16,35,36). The proof of
principle evidence obtained from the data on combinatorial
preventive efficacy now provides a scientifically robust basis
for future mechanistic studies to identify molecular targets
critical for enhanced efficacy. Furthermore, these data also
validate the present experimental approaches for rapid prioritization
of new chemopreventive agents for future animal
studies and subsequent clinical trials. In this context it is noteworthy
that combinatorial efficacy of SUL+DFMO has been
recently reported in a clinical trial on sporadic colon cancer
(34).
Recent evidence suggests that cancer initiating stem cells
representing therapy resistant minor population may be
responsible for frequent acquired tumor resistance to long-term
chemo-endocrine therapy in several heterogeneous epithelial
organ site cancers (37). Established human breast carcinoma
cell lines, such as MCF-7 and T47D as well as clinical breast
cancer specimens, exhibit the presence of cancer initiating stem
cell population (37,38). Normal target organs for these cancers
also exhibit the presence of self renewing, pluripotent stem
cell population (39). Recent research on clinical pancreatic
adenocarcinoma specimens has demonstrated the presence of
CD44+/High/CD24-/Low/ESA enriched stem cells exhibiting the
property of self-renewal, ability for production of differentiated
progeny and accelerated tumor development (40), and
abrogation of stem cell characteristics via synergistic efficacy
of a combination of a synthetic multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib
with a naturally occurring NF-κB inhibitor sulforaphane (41).

MMEC-Myc, and colon epithelial cell lines 850Min COL, 1638N
COL and Mlh1/1638N COL may represent ideal cell culture
systems to generate cancer initiating stem cells and to evaluate
their responses to conventional chemo-endocrine therapy. Such
unique models promise to identify novel preventive/therapeutic
interventions targeted specifically towards therapy resistant
carcinogenic stem cell populations.
