Abstract
Breast cancer patients with tumors lacking the three diagnostic markers (ER, PR, and HER2) are classified as
triple-negative (primarily basal-like) and have poor prognosis because there is no disease-specific therapy
available. To address this unmet medical need, gene expression analyses using more than a thousand breast
cancer samples were conducted, which identified elevated centromere protein E (CENP-E) expression in the
basal-a molecular subtype relative to other subtypes. CENP-E, a mitotic kinesin component of the spindle
assembly checkpoint, is shown to be induced in basal-a tumor cell lines by the mitotic spindle inhibitor drug
docetaxel. CENP-E knockdown by inducible shRNA reduces basal-a breast cancer cell viability. A potent,
selective CENP-E inhibitor (PF-2771) was used to define the contribution of CENP-E motor function to basallike
breast cancer. Mechanistic evaluation of PF-2771 in basal-a tumor cells links CENP-E–dependent
molecular events (e.g., phosphorylation of histone H3 Ser-10; phospho-HH3-Ser10) to functional outcomes
(e.g., chromosomal congression defects). Across a diverse panel of breast cell lines, CENP-E inhibition by PF2771
selectively inhibits proliferation of basal breast cancer cell lines relative to premalignant ones and its
response correlates with the degree of chromosomal instability. Pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic efficacy
analysis in a basal-a xenograft tumor model shows that PF-2771 exposure is well correlated with increased
phospho-HH3-Ser10 levels and tumor growth regression. Complete tumor regression is observed in a patientderived,
basal-a breast cancer xenograft tumor model treated with PF-2771. Tumor regression is also observed
with PF-2771 in a taxane-resistant basal-a model. Taken together, CENP-E may be an effective therapeutic
target for patients with triple-negative/basal-a breast cancer. Mol Cancer Ther; 13(8); 2104–15. 2014 AACR.

Introduction

Breast cancer is many diseases coarsely stratified into
distinct patient populations using three immunohistochemistry
tumor markers: estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone
receptor (PR), and the human epidermal growth
factor receptor-2 (HER2/neu, erbB2; refs. 1, 2). The segment
that does not express any of these markers (triple-negative
breast cancer, TNBC) constitutes 10% to 20% of all patients
with breast cancer, often premenopausalwomen andmembers
of specific ethnic groups such as African decent (3).
Genomic analysis has refined the classification of breast
cancer with the majority of TNBC tumors classified as
basal-like (4). Basal tumor cells are further segmented into
basal-a and basal-b (claudin-low). Understanding breast
cancer tumor biology has powered dramatic improvements
in survival for patients with therapies that target
their specific disease biology. ER-positive breast cancer has
effective therapies such as ER antagonists (e.g., tamoxifen,
FDA-approved in 1977) and estrogen biosynthesis inhibitors
(aromatase drugs, FDA-approved in the 1990s). HER2-
driven disease has effective therapies: trastuzumab (FDAapproved
in 1998), lapatinib (FDA-approved in 2007),
pertuzumab (FDA-approved 2012), and kadcyla (FDAapproved
2013). In contrast, "triple-negative" breast has no
approved targeted therapies and as a consequence, patient
prognosis remains poor (5).
Recent clinical studies suggest that patients with
TNBC respond to standard chemotherapy cytotoxic

regimens (e.g., taxanes; ref. 6), which are also the backbone
to most breast cancer treatments. Taxanes block the
microtubule contribution to mitotic spindles, alter chromosomal
segregation, block the cell-cycle progression,
and therefore inhibit cell proliferation. Unfortunately, the
clinical benefit for patients with TNBC is not durable (6).
In addition, taxanes are known as spindle poisons because
they inhibit functions conserved in normal physiology
and cause severe toxicities (e.g., neutropenia, neuropathy;
refs. 7, 8) A better approach would be if this process could
be selectively modulated in cancer cells. From both efficacy
and tolerability perspectives, improved TNBC therapies
are needed.
Genomic analysis of a broad array of breast cancer
samples identified CENPE as a candidate gene for targeting
TNBC. CENP-E is a component of the kinetochore
complex critical to chromosome congression and alignment
in mitosis as part of the spindle assembly checkpoint
(SAC, mitotic checkpoint; refs. 9–11). CENP-E uses an
ATPase activity (motor function) to slide nonaligned
chromosomes along mitotic spindles toward the equatorial
plate (metaphase plate) and establish metaphase
before chromosome segregation. A potent, specific,
small-molecule inhibitor of CENP-E motor function
(PF-2771) was synthesized and used to characterize the
CENP-E motor function in tumor cells and models. These
studies provide support for a significant role of CENP-E in
the basal-a/TNBC.

Materials and Methods

Cell lines
Cell lines described in this work were obtained from
ATCC. Cell cultures were expanded by serial passaging
and stocks frozen after 3 to 5 passages.

Chromosomal instability index analysis
Chromosomal instability (CIN) index is a measure of
deviation from a diploid state (aneuploidy). To quantify
the degree of global copy-number change in each cell line
(16 lines analyzed), a CIN index was calculated from
genome-wide SNP array data by taking into account both
the length and amplitude of changes as following:

CIN ¼
PL
i¼1 li
ai j j
PL
i¼1 li
;

where li and ai are the length and mean amplitude (on log2
scale) of each copy-number segment, respectively, and L
corresponds to total number of segments in the genome
(chromosomes 1 to 22 and X). Perfectly diploid cells have a
CIN score of zero.

Inducible small hairpin RNA studies
Basal-like breast cancer HCC1806 cells that were engineered
with small hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs were
exposed to doxycycline (1 mg/mL) to induce their expression
(CENP-E specific, GCAGAGAGTGTGGATTCTCAG;
KIF11 shRNA as a positive control; nontargeting,

CAACAAGATGAAGAGCACCAA, luciferase shRNA).
Purified mRNA (Illustra RNAspin Mini Isolation Kit; GE
Healthcare Lifesciences) was converted into cDNA
(qScript cDNA SuperMix; Quanta BioSciences) and analyzed
by qPCR in triplicate (hydrolysis probes and Master
Mix purchased from Applied Biosystems). HCC1806 cell
viability was measured after the shRNA induction. Cells
were seeded the day before doxycycline addition, incubated
with shRNA for 3 days after addition of eight
doxycycline concentrations, PBS washed, trypsinized,
stained with 0.4% trypan blue (Invitrogen), and counted
under microscope.

Biochemical assay of CENP-E enzymatic activity
Microtubule-activated CENP-E kinesin ATPase activity
was measured spectrophotometrically by coupling the
hydrolysis of ATP to ADP to NADH oxidation (decrease
in 340 nm absorbance) through the activities of pyruvate
kinase (PK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Reactions
contained 2 mmol/L phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.28 mmol/L
NADH, 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L DTT, 15 mmol/L
taxol, 0.7 mmol/L MT (preformed porcine microtubules;
Cytoskeleton Inc.), 50 mmol/L ATP, 10 U/mL PK, and 10
U/mL LDH in 15 mmol/L PIPES buffer (pH 7.0). Reactions
were initiated with a 20 nmol/L CENP-E addition
(Human: 1-342; WT) at 30C. The IC50 values were determined
by a nonlinear, least squares fit of the data to the
four-parameter dose–response curve equation (GraphPad
Prism). PF-2771 kinesin biochemical selectivity
toward other kinesins (Cytoskeleton Inc.) was tested in
triplicate at both 1 and 10 mmol/L PF-2771 in a variant of
the CENP-E enzymatic assays that had the following
enzyme concentrations: 200 nmol/L chromokinesin
motor domain, 200 nmol/L Eg5 motor domain, 226
nmol/L MCAK motor domain. PF-2771 biochemical
mechanism was determined by measuring CENP-E enzymatic
activity as a function of ATP and PF-2771 concentrations
(0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 30, 45 nmol/L PF-2771; 1,000, 500,
250, 125, 62.5, 31.2, 15.6, 7.81, 3.90, 1.95, 0.977 mmol/L
ATP).

Cell proliferation assays
PF-2771 was added to cells seeded in 96-well plates. The
number of cells seeded (1,000–3,000) depended on growth
characteristics of each cell type and normalized proliferation
rates. Ten different concentrations of compound
used were based on a half-log increment between 1
nmol/L and either 1 or 25 mmol/L. Cells were incubated
at 37C for 7 days before assessing viability with the
CellTiter-Glo reagent (Promega). Untreated control cells
were 80% to 90% confluent after 7 days of culture. Data
were fitted into a sigmoidal curve-fitting program to
calculate IC50 values.

and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37C with 5% CO2 until
80% to 90% confluence. Cells were then treated with PF2771
at desired concentrations for 8 to 9 hours. PhosphoHH3-Ser10
was measured in triplicate using the PathScan
phospho-HH3-Ser10 Sandwich ELISA Kit (Cell Signaling
Technology). Data were exported and analyzed using a
four-parameter IC50 (GraphPad Prism). In 20% FBS, PF2771
is 48% unbound (free fraction).

Analysis of cell-cycle proteins in tumor cells
MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with PF-2771
(75 nmol/L) for 72 hours. Lysates (with protease and
phosphatase inhibitors added) were resolved by NUPAGE
gels (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes, and probed using antibodies for actin and
cyclin B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), AuroraB/AIM1,
phospho-AuroraA(T288)/B(T232)/C(T198; Cell Signaling
Technology; cat. #2914; 1:500 dilution), phosphoHH3-Ser10,
cleaved PARP (all from Cell Signaling Technology;),
anti-phosphohistone-H2AX Ser139 (Millipore),
securin (Abcam), anti-BubR1 (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.),
and 1:500 dilution anti-CENP-E (cat. #AKIN04-A, Cytoskeleton
Inc.) overnight at 4C. HRP-conjugated secondary
antibodies (GE Healthcare) were incubated (2 hours,
room temperature), detected using a chemiluminescent
substrate (Pierce SuperSignal West Dura; Thermo Fisher
Scientific), and imaged (Alpha Innotech imager; Cell
Biosciences).
Flow cytometry
Analysis of cell-cycle distribution of cells was performed
by flow cytometry. A MDA-MB-468 cell culture
containing 1 to 2
106 cells was treated with the inhibitor
(100 nmol/L) for 96 hours. The cells were fixated in 70%
ethanol and stained with propidium iodine using the
Cycletest Plus Kit (Becton Dickinson). The samples were
analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur Instrument.
The proportion of cells in G1, S, G2–M, aneuploidy or
nongated (sub-G1) was determined using CellQuest v. 2.0
software (Becton Dickinson).
In vivo tumor model studies
HCC1806 tumor cells (3
106
) were implanted in the
mammary fat pad of CB17/lcr.Cg-PrkdcscidLystbg female
mice (Charles River Laboratories). PF-2771 was administered
intraperitoneally (i.p.) to groups of 12 mice at 3, 10,
and 30 mg/kg every day for 14 days and at 100 mg/kg
every day for 4 days followed by 3 days off and then
another 4-day cycle. Tumor volumes were recorded twice
weekly by calipers with the final measurement taken 3
days after the last dose. Tumor growth inhibition (TGI)
was calculated using the formula 100
(1  DT/DC),
where DT (treated) and DC (control) are the mean tumor
volume changes between 1 day after the last dose and the
first-day treatment. Time-to-progression endpoint and
associated tumor growth delay determinations were calculated
using median days to reach to two doublings of
initial tumor size. Statistical comparisons were made
using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett posttests. Other

tumor models had similar methodology except where
noted. PDX-AA1077 is a patient-derived xenograft model
developed from tumor tissue from a triple-negative
patient engrafted to the mammary glands of NSG female
mice to create passage 1 tumor-bearing mice. Surgically
resected tumor tissue was cut into 2- to 4-mm3 fragments
and subcutaneously implanted into the flank of SCID-bg
mice (Charles River Laboratories). Mice with palpable
tumors (passage 6) were randomized before dosing. An
HCC1599 tumor cell line xenograft model was established
from tumor fragments of established tumors and reimplanted
into flank of female SCID mice. When average
tumor size reached 250 mm3
, animals were randomized
into five groups of 10 mice. Animals were treated with
vehicle (daily dosing), 10 mg/kg docetaxel (once per week
dosing), 25 mg/kg docetaxel (once per week dosing), 20
mg/kg paclitaxel (twice per week dosing), or 100 mg/kg
of PF-2771 (every day, i.p.).

PK/PD analysis
Plasma drug concentrations and the pharmacodynamic
endpoint (PD) tumor phospho-HH3-Ser10 responses in
SCID mice bearing orthotopically implanted HCC1806
xenograft tumors (300–500 mm3
) were evaluated for vehicle
or a single intraperitoneal dose of PF-2771. Tumors and
plasma were collected at 1, 4, 8, 24, or 32 hours after dose (3
mice per time point). For plasma pharmacokinetics,
mouse plasma was collected in heparinized vacutainers
following intracardiac puncture. Plasma concentrations
of PF-2771 were measured quantitatively with liquid
chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. The mass
spectrometry was performed using electrospray ionization
in the positive mode with multiple reaction monitoring
(MRM). The plasma-free fraction of PF-2771 in SCID
mouse plasma was measured using the equilibrium dialysis
technique. Samples were extracted with 200 mL of
acetonitrile containing an internal standard and analyzed
by liquid chromatography—tandem mass spectrometry.
The free fraction in plasma (fu) was calculated by the
equation fu ¼ Rbuffer/Rplasma, where Rbuffer and Rplasma
represent the ratio of PF-2771. In mouse plasma, the free
fraction of PF-2771 is calculated to be 0.022.

Results

CENP-E expression is highest in basal-like subtype
among breast cancer patients
Gene expression in samples from 1,163 patients with
breast cancer and 160 normal breast tissue samples were
analyzed to identify dysregulated genes (public database;
ref. 12). Although CENPE mRNA is significantly elevated
across all segments of breast cancer relative to normal
tissue, it is the highest in the basal-a subtype (P ¼ 2.22 1067
by two-tailed t test, fold change ¼ 2.93; Fig. 1A).
Analysis of breast cancer patient survival data reveals that
the level of CENPE expression is strongly negatively
correlated with disease-specific survival (P ¼ 3.68 107
by log-rank test; Fig. 1B), indicating that CENP-E
likely is involved in breast cancer biology. These patterns

are subsequently corroborated using an independent
cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; ref. 4).
An evaluation of other mitotic regulators showed that
their expression was also upregulated but the biology of
CENP-E pointed to its potential driver role as a kinesin in
cancer cells. To establish preclinical model systems,
CENP-E protein expression was shown to be present in
three basal-a breast cancer cell lines (HCC70, HCC1806,
and MDA-MB-468). The response of CENP-E to spindle
inhibitor treatment was evaluated in these cell lines (100
nmol/L docetaxel; 16 hours). CENP-E protein accumulates
and the tumor cells undergo mitotic arrest (Fig. 2).
Phosphorylation of BubR1 and HH3 were evaluated to
provide mechanistic evidence for the activation of the
SAC. Docetaxel treatment induced phosphorylation of
serine residue 10 of histone H3 as well as BubR1 (supershifted
bands in the SDS-PAGE; Fig. 2). Next, an inducible
shRNA approach is used to characterize the consequences

of CENP-E protein depletion on the in vitro viability of
HCC1806 basal-like breast tumor cells. The CENP-E
shRNA causes an 83% to 88% reduction of CENP-E
mRNA 24 and 48 hours after transfection of cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1A) and a greater than 90% reduction in
CENP-E protein levels compared with the untransfected
cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Upon doxycycline induction
of specific CENP-E shRNA, only 20% of the HCC1806
tumor cells remain viable after 72 hours (Supplementary
Fig. S1C). From this analysis, CENP-E is hypothesized to
be critical in basal-a breast cancer cell biology.

PF-2771 is a potent, noncompetitive, selective
inhibitor of CENP-E motor function
Because CENP-E is known to have both catalytic
(ATPase motor activity) and noncatalytic functions (13),
a more specific approach than shRNA knockdown is
needed to study CENP-E ATPase motor function. To

CENP-E Motor Function in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer

facilitate this analysis, the potent, selective inhibitor PF2771
was synthesized, (Fig. 3, Supplementary Methods).
This molecule inhibits CENP-E motor activity with an IC50
of 16.1  1.2 nmol/L (n ¼ 18) and a Hill slope of 0.94.
Kinetic analysis of PF-2771 inhibition conducted as a
function of ATP and PF-2771 concentrations is consistent
with it being noncompetitive toward ATP (1/velocity
vs. 1/[ATP] at varied [PF-2771] lines do not converge at
the 1/v axis). PF-2771 does not inhibit the ATPase activities
of highly related kinesins (0% inhibition of Eg5/KSP,
chromokinesin, and MCAK at both 1 or 10 mmol/L PF2771).
PF-2771 is inactive toward a panel of 74 protein
kinases (all <23% inhibition with 1 mmol/L PF-2771, <40%
with 10 mmol/L PF-2771; Supplementary Table S1). The
characterization of PF-2771 as a selective inhibitor of
CENP-E motor activity enables its use as a probe of
CENP-E biology in more complex systems.

PF-2771 is a specific CENP-E inhibitor critical to
basal-like breast cancer tumor cell survival
Appropriate breast cancer contexts for studying PF2771
were initially identified by measuring the sensitivity

of breast cell lines to inhibition of CENP-E motor activity.
The antiproliferative potency of PF-2771 (EC50 after 72
hours of treatment) was measured in 16 cell lines that span
the following breast segments: normal breast epithelial
cells, premalignant, basal-a, basal-b (claudin-low), luminal,
and HER-2 positive (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table
S2). Cell line models lacking the receptors the define
TNBC (HER-2, ER, and PR) encompass both basal-a and
basal-b models. PF-2771 potency varies by three orders of
magnitude across one cell line (0.01 to >10 mmol/L). All six
cell lines sensitive to PF-2771 (EC50 < 0.1 mmol/L) are
basal-like with five of these in the basal-a subset. In
contrast, the normal and premalignant cell lines are not
sensitive to PF-2771 treatment (EC50 > 5 mmol/L). These
results suggest that CENP-E motor activity is necessary
for breast cancer cell proliferation but dispensable for
normal breast cell proliferation. Because PF-2771 is a
potent inhibitor of basal-a tumor cell growth, two representative
cell lines were selected for mechanistic analyses
(MDA-MB-468 and HCC1806).
The molecular consequences of PF-2771 treatment in
basal-a breast cancer cells were subsequently characterized
to determine if they are consistent with CENP-E
inhibition. CENP-E is known to be required for cell-cycle
progression from metaphase to anaphase (13). Phosphorylation
of the histone H3 Ser-10 (HH3-Ser10) is used as a
marker of CENP-E motor function because it is mediated
by Aurora-B, coincident with chromosomal condensation,
and decreases upon transition to anaphase (PF-2771 is not
an Aurora-B inhibitor, Supplementary Table S1; ref. 14).
The EC50 for the elevated phospho-HH3-Ser10 was determined
to be 21 and 22 nmol/L in MDA-MB-468 and
HCC1806 cells, respectively. The elevation of HH3-Ser10
phosphorylation is well correlated with inhibition of
tumor cell proliferation (EC50, 14–20 nmol/L) as well as
inhibition of ATPase motor activity in a biochemical assay
(IC50, 16 nmol/L). A broader analysis of cellular effects of
PF-2771 was undertaken by investigating other mitotic
checkpoint proteins that are directly or indirectly associated
with CENP-E (15, 16). PF-2771 treatment (75 nmol/L)
of MDA-MB-468 tumor cells for 8 hours increases levels of
phosphorylated BubR1, Aurora-B, securin, and cyclin B
(Fig. 5). These results are consistent with PF-2771–dependent
induction of mitotic arrest and the engagement of the
SAC. At 24 hours after treatment of PF-2771, these markers
of mitosis decrease, whereas increases in gH2AX (DNA
damage) and cleaved PARP (apoptosis) proteins are
observed.
The functional effects of PF-2771 treatment on tumor
cells were characterized to better define the role of CENPE
motor activity in basal-like breast cancer biology. As
CENP-E regulates the spindle assembly cell-cycle checkpoint,
alterations in the cell-cycle profile are evaluated.
Treatment of basal-a breast cancer tumor cells for 6 hours
with 100 nmol/L PF-2771 causes an increase in the G2–M
cell population of basal-like tumor cells (43% MDA-MB468
cells in G2–M) relative to asynchronous, untreated
cells (24% G2–M; Supplementary Table S3). The time

course of the cell-cycle effects caused by PF-2771 treatment
shows a rapid accumulation of cells at the G2–M
stage followed by a large increase in the sub-G0 population
(Supplementary Table S3). It should be noted that
normal breast cells have a small G2–M population (G0–G1
 85%; ref. 17). After 96 hours, the sub-G1 cell population
is 23% compared with 5% in control cells; consistent with
onset of apoptosis following mitotic delay (Supplementary
Table S3). Because this cell-cycle phenotype is not
exclusive to CENP-E, other more specific functional
effects were investigated such as chromosome congression—a
process necessary for the establishment of bidirectional
chromosome/kinetochore attachments before
the onset of anaphase (18). Exposure of tumor cells to a
bona fide CENP-E inhibitor should result in mitotic delay
due to the presence of uncongressed chromosomes. Basala
tumor cells (MDA-MB-468) were engineered to constitutively
express the fluorescent reporter histone-2B green
fluorescent protein (H2B-GFP) to follow chromosome
dynamics through fluorescent live-cell video microscopy
(Fig. 6). Vehicle-treated cells complete mitosis in
approximately 1 hour as measured by nuclear envelope
breakdown to onset of cytokinesis. In contrast, 100
nmol/L PF-2771–treated tumor cells display a delayed
metaphase–anaphase transition (3 hours) followed by
either mitotic apoptosis or mitotic slippage with subsequent
apoptosis (Fig. 6). In contrast, PF-2771 does not
exhibit the characteristic phenotype associated with
inhibition of the related kinesin EG5/KSP. EG5/KSP
inhibitors (e.g., ispinesib) trigger the formation of
monopolar spindles (19), a phenotype that is not
observed in tumor cells exposed to PF-2771 (Supplementary
Fig. S2). A chromosome congression defect is
observed in the PF-2771–treated cells because chromosomes
remained distant from the metaphase plate for at

least twice as long as vehicle-treated cells. Taken together,
PF-2771 modulates CENP-E dependent molecular
markers in basal-like breast cancer cells and has the
functional hallmarks of a selective CENP-E inhibitor.

Cellular sensitivity to inhibition of CENP-E motor
function is correlated with degree of CIN
An evaluation of the relationship between CENP-E
expression and PF-2771 response finds that there is no
statistically significant difference in CENP-E mRNA
levels between sensitive and resistant cell lines (P ¼
0.52 by two-tailed t test). As SAC defects are found in
cancer cells with high levels of CIN (20, 21), a plausible
hypothesis is that tumors with this phenotype are more
reliant on genes that regulate the SAC and therefore
sensitive to inhibition of CENP-E motor function. Furthermore,
high CIN tumor cells are enriched for cells with
merotelic chromosomal attachments (lagging chromosomes;
ref. 22). A CIN index measurement is devised to
quantify the overall level of DNA copy-number change in
various breast cell lines. Cell lines are divided into sensitive
and resistant groups based on response to PF-2771
(EC50 cutoff was 0.1 mmol/L). Tumor cell lines sensitive to
PF-2771 have a much higher CIN index score than resistant
ones (P ¼ 0.022 by two-tailed t test), suggesting that
breast cancer tumors with elevated chromosomal instability
are likely to benefit from CENP-E–targeted therapy.

(basal-a) taxane-resistant tumor xenograft model.
TGI of the HCC1806 model is observed to be 24% at
30 mg/kg (P ¼ 0.046 by t test) and 62% regression at
100 mg/kg (P ¼ 9.4
108 by t test) measured after
14 days of PF-2771 treatment (Fig. 7A). Animals treated
with PF-2771 exhibited no significant body weight loss
(<10%; Supplementary Fig. S3) and displayed normal
grooming and other behaviors. Single-dose treatment
with 100 mg/kg of PF-2771 results in significant elevation
(up to 6-fold increase) of phospho-HH3-Ser10, which was
sustained up to 24 hours (Fig. 7B).
To better define the role of CENP-E inhibition in the
HCC1806 xenograft model, we quantified the temporal
relationship between plasma concentrations of PF-2771, a
pharmacodynamic marker for CENP-E inhibition, and
subsequent TGI. Phosphorylation of histone H3 residue
Ser-10 is evaluated because it is well correlated with other
SAC functions in cellular studies of PF-2771 and is a robust
marker of mitotic arrest and SAC activation (14). A
detailed description of the mathematical PK/PD modeling
methods and results can be found in the Supplementary
Methods. Briefly, tumor cell growth and kill rates in
the mathematical model represent the overall growth
and death rates of cells comprising the tumor volume in
the mouse (Supplementary Fig. S4, right). The growth

rate slows as the tumor increases in volume as seen in
the control group (Supplementary Fig. S4, center). The
kill rate is a function of the concentration of the CENP-E
inhibitor in the system, consistent with the hypothesis
that inhibition of CENP-E motor function induces apoptosis.
The in vivo EC50 of PF-2771 for phospho-HH3-
Ser10 elevation is estimated by the mathematical model
to be 4.1 nmol/L (free-drug concentration). The elevated
phosphoHH3-Ser10 levels are responsive in a predicable
fashion, consistent with a standard Hill function
(Supplementary Fig. S4). The in vivo EC50 value is
consistent with the in vitro cellular IC50 (11 nmol/L)
in the HCC1806 cell line as well as the biochemical
potency (IC50, 16 nmol/L). The modeling results also
highlight the inability of lower PF-2771 doses (3, 10, and
30 mg/kg) to increase the kill rate and sustain it at an
adequate level to significantly slow (or regress) tumor
growth. However, in the 100 mg/kg group, a significantly
elevated kill rate is sustained during dosing, thus
overpowering the growth rate and causing tumor
regression. These results establish a strong correlation
between inhibition of CENP-E motor function and efficacy
in basal-a breast cancer.
To study CENP-E motor function in a model that
better reflects breast cancer patient biology, PF-2771
was evaluated in an patient-derived TNBC model that
is generated by directly engrafting primary human
tumor tissue into murine mammary tissue (PDXAA1077;
ref. 23). By genome-wide gene expression
profiling, we confirm that the xenograft tumor is from
basal-a breast cancer. The Pearson correlation with
intrinsic centroids for PDZ-AA1077 are as follows:
0.2067 (basal-like), 0.0269 (Her-2), 0.1437 (luminala),
0.0665 (luminal-b), and 0.0165 (normal-like).
SCID mice bearing AA1077 mammary tumors treated
with a PF-2771 dose known to potently inhibit CENP-E
motor function (100 mg/kg every day i.p.) exhibit
tumor regression (99.97%; Fig. 8A). This finding provides
additional support that inhibition of CENP-E
motor function could be efficacious in a selected patient
population.
PF-2771 was used to evaluate CENP-E motor function
inhibition relative to mitotic spindle inhibitors
(paclitaxel and docetaxel) in the HCC1599 basal-a
tumor model. At clinically relevant murine doses
(24), paclitaxel (20 mg/kg twice weekly) and docetaxel
(25 mg/kg/week) had moderate efficacy in the
HCC1599 model (paclitaxel TGI 78%, P ¼ 2.63
108
by t test; docetaxel 76% TGI, P ¼ 2.74
108 by t test).
As such, the HCC1599 model is less responsive to taxane
treatment compared with other breast cancer models.
In contrast, at an effective PF-2771 dose (100 mg/kg every
day), substantial tumor regression is observed in this
model (64% regression, P ¼ 7.63
109 by t
test; Fig. 8B). These results suggest that a CENP-Einhibitor
could be more effective than traditional chemotherapies
for a subset of patients and that CENP-E inhibitors may be
mechanistically distinct from spindle poisons.

blot analyses of lysates from MDA-MB-468 cells treated with 75 nmol/L
PF-2771 for up to 72 hours.

Discussion

A major paradigm change in the treatment of patients
with cancer is under way—matching a targeted therapy to
a molecular event essential to a specific tumor biology.
When this occurs, profound clinical benefit is realized as
observed with imatinib in BCR-ABL–dependent leukemia,
vemurafenib and dabrafenib in Braf V600E-driven
melanoma, and crizotinib in EML4–ALK–positive lung
cancer. Through a combination of genomic and chemical
biologic approaches, we characterize the kinesin CENP-E
as critical to basal-a, TNBC. To date, CENP-E–directed
therapies have not been broadly pursued, in part, due to
the notion that cell-cycle inhibitors will be similar to
classic cytotoxic agents. However, recent clinical findings
on the cell-cycle checkpoint inhibitor palbociclib (CDK4/
6 inhibitor) demonstrate that this type of intervention can
be well tolerated with profound therapeutic benefit (25).
CENP-E is a member of the kinesin super family of 650
motor proteins that use the energy from ATP hydrolysis to
transport cellular cargos (11, 26). CENP-E has an N-terminal
catalytic motor domain, a discontinuous a-helical
coiled-coil stalk domain, and a C-terminal ATP-independent
microtubule-binding domain (10, 11). Depletion of
CENP-E leads to mitotic arrest due to the presence of
unaligned chromosomes (27). We show that CENP-E

accumulates in basal-a breast cancer cells following taxane
treatment. Previous studies show that CENP-E protein
turnover occurs after the completion of mitosis (11).
As taxanes are known to induce a mitotic arrest, lysates
made from taxane-treated cells should, therefore, show an
enhanced amount of CENP-E protein. Evidence for the
therapeutic benefit of inhibiting CENP-E comes from
previous studies of mice with one CENP-E allele (heterozygous
for CENP-E), which exhibit decreased incidence of
tumors induced by carcinogens or from the heterozygous
deletion of the tumor suppressor p19ARF (28). A recent
study reports that CENP-E protein has cellular activities
in addition to its motor function (29). Therefore, eliminating
or knocking down the expression of an entire CENP-E
protein provides valuable information but lacks the resolution
to characterize specific protein functions.
Unlike other therapeutic targets (e.g., protein kinases),
there are a limited number of kinesin inhibitors and even
fewer CENP-E inhibitors available to investigate their
biologic roles in cancer. UA62784 has been reported to
be a CENP-E inhibitor (30), yet subsequent mechanistic
studies show that UA62784 does not exert its cellular
activity by inhibiting CENP-E but by binding microtubules
tightly (31). GSK923295 is an allosteric inhibitor of
CENP-E, which advanced to a phase I clinical trial of

unselected patients with cancer with refractory disease
(27, 32). Although the therapy was well tolerated, the
utility of this agent in an unselected patient population
was modest with a single partial response reported. This
may be due to either insufficient pharmacodynamic modulation
of CENP-E or the selection of an incorrect patient
population. A third CENP-E inhibitor (syntelin) has been
reported to have moderate potency (IC50, 160 nmol/L),
but has only been studied in cellular systems (33). As such,
there is a need for a selective CENP-E inhibitor with a
well-defined mechanism of action and sufficient pharmaceutical
properties to define a patient selection hypothesis
to test in the clinic.
The inhibitor PF-2771 was developed to investigate the
role of CENP-E motor function in TNBC. Biochemical
analysis of PF-2771 is consistent with it being a potent,

selective inhibitor of the CENP-E motor function. A
detailed evaluation of PF-2771 in basal-a breast cancer
tumor cells is consistent with specific CENP-E inhibition
and therefore useful for studying CENP-E motor function
in tumor models. Because tumor cell line–derived tumor
models do not fully capture disease biology, in part,
because they are adapted to grow in two-dimensional

(2D) culture, we evaluated PF-2771 in a patient-derived,
basal-a tumor model. This approach is emerging as a
superior method to predict clinical efficacy (34). At PF2771
doses expected to inhibit CENP-E motor function,
complete tumor regression in the patient-derived model is
observed, which predicts a likelihood of clinical benefit for
this segment of breast cancer. In addition, PF-2771 demonstrates
better efficacy as compared with taxanes in another
triple-negative, basal-a breast tumor model (HCC1599),
which we show to be partially insensitive to taxane treatment.
These findings provide evidence that abrogating
the SAC by inhibiting CENP-E motor activity may be an
effective treatment for patients with basal-a TNBC.
There is significant pressure to accelerate the discovery
of new cancer therapies by conducting more effective
clinical trials. Central to this task is determining if
inhibition of the intended drug target is effective in
managing disease—does modulation of a therapeutic
target-specific molecular pharmacodynamic biomarker
correlate with efficacy? This detailed analysis has been
lacking for both preclinical and clinical studies of
CENP-E inhibitors. Previously published findings show
a lack of efficacy of a different CENP-E inhibitor
(GSK923295) in the MX-1 breast cancer model (no
regression observed in animals dosed with either 62.5
mg/kg or 125 mg/kg; ref. 27). In this study, one does
not know if an insensitive patient population (tumor
model) was selected or if the inhibitor failed to inhibit
CENP-E in the tumor. With the preclinical studies of PF2771,
both of these variables are well understood. Interestingly,
GSK932295 is reported to be selectively potent
toward basal-b tumor cells (AACR poster, April 2009)
and induces MX-1 cell arrest briefly without subsequent
apoptosis (AACR-NCI-EORTC poster, October 2007)—
strikingly different findings than we report for PF-2771.
Inhibition of CENP-E motor function by PF-2771
resulted in tumor regression in a HCC1806 basal-like
breast cancer xenograft tumor model (also HCC70, data
not shown). Importantly, the tumor regression driven
by PF-2771 occurs concurrently with cell-cycle arrest as
evidenced by dose-dependent elevation of phosphoHH3-Ser10
levels. Detailed PK/PD modeling demonstrated
that PF-2771–dependent TGI/regression is highly
correlated with antimitotic properties expected for
CENP-E inhibition and, thus, suggests the basis of
efficacy.
Analysis of PF-2771 antiproliferative cell potency
revealed a paradox that cell line sensitivity to PF-2771 is
poorly correlated with CENP-E gene expression. This
relationship can be expected to be complicated because
PF-2771 only inhibits the CENP-E motor function and
spares the motor-independent functions (13). Nonetheless,
there is a wide range of PF-2771 activities observed
from potent inhibition of basal-a breast cancer cell to
insensitivity in premalignant cells. The strong correlation
observed between PF-2771 cell line sensitivity and CIN is
interesting and potentially useful. When reevaluating cell
line sensitivity to PF-2771, the contribution of CIN to the

disease segment may be a critical attribute. For example,
basal-a breast cancer is known to have high genomic
instability (35). Although genomic instability is a hallmark
of human cancer (36), tumor genomes vary considerably
in the level of instability that they harbor (37) and the
mechanisms by which they become unstable (35). Importantly,
patients with highly unstable tumor genomes often
have poorer prognosis (37–40). The subset of genomic
instability known as CIN is caused by multiple mechanisms
such as (i) faulty sister chromatid cohesion, (ii)
defective centrosome duplication, (iii) telomere dysfunction,
(iv) overly stable attachments of microtubules to
chromosomes, and (v) hyperactive or hypoactive SAC
(22). Recent studies of reduced CENP-E through the loss
of an allele, CENP-E (þ/), report that tumor cells that do
not arise from CIN are unaffected by CENP-E–dependent
chromosomal missegregation (41). Our pharmacologic
studies coupled with these genetic studies indicate that
tumor cells with high CIN may have "induced essentiality"
of CENP-E (related to the genetic concept of syntheticlethal;
refs. 42, 43). The preferential cytotoxicity of PF-2771
to tumor cells with high CIN relative could be because
these cells rely on CENP-E to accommodate the chromosomal
instability. An alternative hypothesis (not mutually
exclusive) is that CENP-E supports a tumor’s use of CIN
as a cellular mechanism to generate tumor genomic diversity,
a trait that would favor the emergence of drug
resistance. The clinical utility of induced essentiality has
been demonstrated with related DNA damage repair
machinery. Inhibiting the single-strand DNA repair
enzyme PARP in tumors with mutations in the DNA
damage tumor-suppressor BRCA1/2 is proving to be
clinically effective (43). Taken together, these findings
indicate that basal-a TNBC and other patient populations
with chromosomal instability (44, 45) may benefit from a
CENP-E–targeted therapy.
PF-2771 is useful in evaluating potential safety liabilities
of inhibiting CENP-E, a concern with inhibiting any
cell cycle–related enzyme. We find evidence that CENPE
inhibition could be well tolerated in patients. Normal
breast cells are not affected by PF-2771, which supports
the hypothesis that inhibiting CENP-E will be synthetic
lethal to tumor cells. Multiple in vivo studies show that
PF-2771 is well tolerated. In a recent phase I clinical
study on a different CENP-E inhibitor, a well-known
taxane adverse effect (neuropathy) is not listed among
the adverse events (27). As such, CENP-E inhibitors
have the potential to be better tolerated than taxanes
and possibly easier to use in combination with other
cancer therapies. Our comprehensive analysis of CENPE
supports the hypothesis that this mitotic kinesin is a
therapeutic target for the treatment of the triple-negative/basal-a
segment of breast cancer with possibilities
in other CIN-dependent cancers.
