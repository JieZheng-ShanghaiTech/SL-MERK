Abstract
Purpose: Restoration of the p53 function in tumors is a promising therapeutic strategy due to the high
potential of p53 as tumor suppressor and the fact that established tumors depend on p53 inactivation for
their survival. Here, we addressed the question whether small molecule RITA can reactivate p53 in
neuroblastoma and suppress the growth of neuroblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo.
Experimental Design: The ability of RITA to inhibit growth and to induce apoptosis was shown in seven
neuroblastoma cell lines. Mechanistic studies were carried out to determine the p53 dependence and the
molecular mechanism of RITA-induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma, using cell viability assays, RNAi
silencing, co-immunoprecipitation, qPCR, and Western blotting analysis. In vivo experiments were conducted
to study the effect of RITA on human neuroblastoma xenografts in mice.
Results: RITA induced p53-dependent apoptosis in a set of seven neuroblastoma cell lines, carrying
wild-type or mutant p53; it activated p53 and triggered the expression of proapoptotic p53 target genes.
Importantly, p53 activated by RITA inhibited several key oncogenes that are high-priority targets for
pharmacologic anticancer strategies in neuroblastoma, including N-Myc, Aurora kinase, Mcl-1, Bcl-2,
Wip-1, MDM2, and MDMX. Moreover, RITA had a strong antitumor effect in vivo.
Conclusions: Reactivation of wild-type and mutant p53 resulting in the induction of proapoptotic
factors along with ablation of key oncogenes by compounds such as RITA may be a highly effective strategy
to treat neuroblastoma. Clin Cancer Res; 19(18); 5092–103. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Neuroblastoma (NB) belongs to the most challenging
oncologic diseases of childhood. Despite intensive multimodal
therapy, often resulting in good immediate response
in many children, high-risk neuroblastoma frequently
acquires therapy resistance with fatal clinical outcome
(1). There is a strong need to develop novel targeted strategies
that inhibit specific neuroblastoma pathways and key
molecules for its growth and progression.
Among the diversity of genetic variations in neuroblastoma,
MYCN amplification, leading to overexpression of
the transcription factor N-Myc, is a genetic hallmark of the
disease and an independent marker of dismal prognosis
(1, 2). Selective targeting of N-Myc in neuroblastoma cells

using different approaches showed encouraging results and
provides a promising treatment strategy (3). In addition,
several other oncogenes have been implicated in neuroblastoma
tumorigenesis, invasion, and dissemination and
are regarded as targets for therapy (4). Among others, these
include PPM1D, which encodes oncogenic phosphatase
Wip1 (wild-type p53 induced phosphatase 1), increased
expression of which is likely to be associated with 17q gain,
a predictor of poor prognosis (5). Recent studies have
shown a correlation between high expression of antiapoptotic
factors Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 and resistance to therapy in
neuroblastoma (6). Mcl-1 depletion via RNA interference
induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma cell lines and sensitized
them to cytotoxic chemotherapy, suggesting that
Mcl-1, as well as Bcl-2, might be promising targets for
neuroblastoma treatment (6, 7).
Notably, chemotherapy-resistant neuroblastoma often
express p53 inactivated by a point mutation (8–10). p53
is the potent tumor suppressor, which halts tumor progression
by inducing apoptosis or cell-cycle arrest (11). p53 is
inactivated in the majority of human tumors, either by
point mutation of the gene or via its inhibitors, mainly
MDM2 and MDMX. MDM2 ubiquitinates p53 and marks it
for destruction by the proteasome, thus keeping p53 at bay

in the absence of stress (11). MDMX is a paralog of
MDM2 required for the efficient inhibition of p53 by
MDM2, but it can also suppress p53 function independently
of MDM2, therefore maximal activation of p53 requires
inhibition of both MDM2 and MDMX (12). Multiple
studies provided evidence of the crucial role of p53 for
tumor suppression, as well as for response to anticancer
therapy in different types of cancer including high-risk
neuroblastoma (13).
p53 dysfunction in neuroblastoma has been linked to
MDM2 amplification and Wip1 activation (5, 14), as well
as to homozygous deletions of CDKN2A, encoding MDM2
inhibitor p14ARF (15). Moreover, N-Myc inactivates p53
by inducing the expression of MDM2 (16), which in turn
upregulates N-Myc (17). p53 mutations occur very seldom
in neuroblastoma, but in cell lines established at relapse
p53 mutations are more frequent, implicating mutant
p53 in the development of therapy-resistant phenotype
(8, 9).
Albeit inactive, the p53 protein is expressed in cancers,
leading to the idea of p53 reactivation to combat cancer
(18). Moreover, in vivo studies in animal models showed
that re-instatement of p53 has much more profound tumor
suppressor effects in aggressive, metastatic tumors (19, 20).
These data greatly encouraged us to explore the effect of
p53-reactivating molecules in neuroblastoma.
Several p53-reactivating molecules have been developed
and at least 2 of them are currently being tested in clinical
trials: MDM2 inhibitor nutlin3a discovered by Hoffmann
La Roche (21) and the mutant p53-reactivating compound
PRIMA-1MET/APR-246, identified by us (22). Nutlin3a has

been shown to activate p53-dependent growth suppression
in neuroblastoma carrying wild-type (wt) p53 in vitro and in
vivo (23, 24). Evidence that defects in effector molecules
downstream of p53 are remarkably rare in neuroblastoma
leads further support to the strategy to restore the function
of p53 in neuroblastoma (25).
However, recent studies show that treatment with
nutlin3a creates a selective pressure for p53 mutations in
neuroblastoma and other types of cancer leading to nutlin3a
resistance, which in some cases contributes to multidrug
resistance (26, 27). Thus, it might be beneficial to develop
therapies which will simultaneously reactivate wild-type and
mutant p53.
We have identified a small molecule RITA which binds to
the N-terminus of p53 and induces a conformational
change blocking its interaction with MDM2, leading to the
robust induction of apoptosis in cancer cells of different
origin in vitro and in vivo, without apparent toxic effects (28–
32). Notably, RITA can also reactivate mutant p53, probably
because RITA treatment impinges on p53 conformation
(31). Furthermore, reactivation of p53 by RITA leads to the
ablation of survival signaling in cancer cells via downregulation
of Myc, Bcl-2, Mcl-1,Wip-1, MDMX, and other oncogenes
(30, 33). Taken together, these data inspired us to test
whether RITA is capable of restoring wild-type and mutant
p53 activity in neuroblastoma.
Here, we report that RITA triggers robust apoptosis in
different neuroblastoma lines, including the ones with
mutant p53. RITA-activated p53 induces the expression of
its proapoptotic target genes such as PUMA and Noxa and
also a rapid and substantial downregulation of several key
survival factors in neuroblastoma, including N-Myc, Aurora
kinase A, MDM2, MDMX, Wip1, and Mcl-1. Notably, RITA
efficiently suppressed the growth of human neuroblastoma
xenografts in mice.

Translational Relevance
There is a strong need for novel target-specific therapeutic
approaches to treat high-risk neuroblastoma.
Restoration of p53 is a promising strategy to treat cancer.
Several compounds reactivating p53 are currently being
tested in clinical trials. Unlike chemotherapy regimens
which kill healthy cells along with tumor cells, leading to
severe side effects, target-specific drugs spare normal
cells, and have the potential to be well-tolerated therapies,
which will enable patients with cancer to live longer
and have an improved quality of life. Here we report that
reactivation of p53 by target-specific molecule RITA
triggers ablation of key factors crucial for neuroblastoma
survival, including N-Myc, the driving oncogene in neuroblastoma.
Inhibition of oncogenes by p53 may thus
constitute a new therapeutic approach for high-risk
neuroblastomas. The capability of p53 to target several
oncogenes might allow p53-based therapies to cope with
the daunting challenge of therapy—multiple genetic
abnormalities in individual cancers. With no current
satisfactory strategy for treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma,
it would be highly relevant to implement this
strategy in the clinic.

medium, all other cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Medium. Plasmid DNA and siRNA transfections
were conducted with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plasmid
encoding p53shRNA was kindly provided by A. Jochemsen
(The Netherlands).

Growth suppression assays
For long-term viability assay, 100,000 cells were seeded
in 12-well plates, treated with RITA for 2 weeks and stained
with crystal violet. For short-term viability assay, 3,000
cells/well were plated in a 96-well plate, treated with RITA
for 48 hours, and cell viability was assessed using proliferation
reagent WST-1 (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. TUNEL assay was conducted as we
previously described (34). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) analysis of the propidium iodide–stained cells
was conducted as in ref. 29.

Antibodies and Western blotting
The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal
anti-p53 CM1 was from Novocasta; antibodies for
p53 (DO-1, FL393), PARP (H-250), Mcl-1 (S-19), N-Myc
(C-19), MDM2 (SMP14), Bax (N-20), Bcl-2 (C-2), from
Santa Cruz. Anti-actin (AC15) from SIGMA and anti-p21
(Cip1/waf1) from Nordic Biosite. Antibodies for Noxa and
PUMA (Ab-1) from Calbiochem, anti-MDMX (S403) and
anti-Wip1 antibodies from Bethyl. Immunoblotting was
conducted according to standard procedures.

Chemicals
Pifithrin-a(PFTa), a kind gift from A. Gudkov (USA), was
used at 10 mmol/L 2 hours before RITA treatment. The
proteasomal inhibitor MG132 was used at a concentration
of 20 mmol/L. RITA was obtained from National Cancer
research Institute (USA).

Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)–PCR
Total RNA was extracted and purified with an RNeasy
kit (QIAGEN) using the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA
(5 mg) was reverse transcribed using a SuperScript FirstStrand
RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was conducted
with SYBR green reagent (Applied Biosystems)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Primers used
for real-time RT-PCR were as we previously described
(29, 30).

Co-immunoprecipitation
Neuroblastoma cells were treated with 1 mmol/L RITA
and harvested after 24 hours. Lysates (500 mg) were precleared
with Protein A agarose beads and rabbit immunoglobulin
G (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) before immunoprecipitation
with anti-p53 antibody FL-393 conjugated to
agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). Beads were
washed 5 times with IP buffer (50 mmol/L Tris, pH 7.5, 5
mmol/L EDTA, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5% NP-40). Bound
proteins were detected by Western blotting using MDM2
and MDMX antibodies.

In vivo experiments
The Northern Stockholm Animal Ethical Committee
approved all animal studies and animal care was in accordance
with the Karolinska Institutet guidelines. SKN-DZ
cells (3  107
) were injected subcutaneously on the left and
right flanks of 6- to 8-week-old female severe combined
immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Xenografts seemed palpable
7 days after inoculation, at which time the treatment was
started. The mice were treated by intraperitoneal injections
twice daily with injection of 200 mL solution containing 10
mg/kg of RITA and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in PBS
or 5% DMSO in PBS for a period of 18 days. Xenograft
volumes were measured every day. Animals were sacrificed
on the last day of treatment; tumors were extracted, weighted,
and photographed. Body weight of mice was measured
before and after treatment.

Results
RITA inhibits the growth of neuroblastoma cells
We have previously shown that p53 reactivating compound
RITA prevents p53/MDM2 interaction, induces p53
accumulation and activation, and triggers apoptosis in
tumor cells of a different origin in vitro and in vivo (28–
32). Here, we tested the effects of RITA in 7 neuroblastoma
cell lines, differing in N-Myc and p53 status (Table 1).
Treatment with RITA efficiently suppressed the growth of
neuroblastoma cell lines expressing wild-type p53 in a dosedependent
manner, as detected by cell-proliferation assay
(Fig. 1A). These include 2 cell lines with amplified N-Myc,
SKN-DZ, and IMR32. Furthermore, a long-term viability
assay showed that treatment with RITA purged the entire
population of neuroblastoma cells, leaving virtually no
alive cells after several days of treatment (Fig. 1B).
In addition to the activation of the wtp53 activity, RITA
can also restore the activity of mutant p53 in human tumor
cells of different origin (31). In line with these results, we
found that RITA efficiently inhibited the growth of SKN-BE
(2) cells, which express C135F p53 mutant and SKN-FI,
carrying M246R p53 mutant, as assessed in short- and longterm
viability assays (Fig. 1A and B). In addition, the growth
of SKN-AS cell line carrying p53 truncated at its very Cterminus,
but retaining partial p53 activity (35), was also
inhibited by RITA.
Thus, RITA efficiently suppressed the growth of neuroblastoma
cells, carrying both wild-type and mutant p53,
with or without N-Myc amplification.

RITA induces apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells
Nutlin3a, an inhibitor of p53/MDM2 interaction,
induces a pronounced growth arrest and senescent phenotype
in neuroblastoma cells (23). However, we did not
observe senescent cells upon treatment with RITA. Microscopy
analysis of cell morphology revealed the induction of
cell death by RITA in all cell lines tested (Fig. 2A). Furthermore,
we detected DNA fragmentation, the hallmark of
apoptosis using TUNEL assay (Fig. 2B). Activation of caspases,
manifested as induction of PARP cleavage, served as
an additional proof of apoptosis. Using immunoblotting,

we showed the induction of PARP cleavage upon RITA in
several neuroblastoma lines (Fig. 2C). Appearance of
fragmented DNA, another indication of apoptosis, was
observed upon FACS analysis of propidium iodide–stained
SKN-BE(2) cells (Fig. 2D) and, as shown later, in SHEP and
SKN-DZ cells. Taken together, our results strongly suggest
that RITA induces neuroblastoma cell death via apoptosis.

RITA disrupts the interaction between p53 and
MDM2/MDMX
We have previously shown that RITA induces apoptosis
due to disruption of the p53/MDM2 complex (28), and also
found similar inhibitory effect on the p53/MDMX complex.
In line with these results, we found that RITA significantly
decreased the complex formation between p53 and MDM2,
as well as between p53 and MDMX, as assessed by coimmunoprecipitation
assay (Fig. 3A). These data suggest
that in wild type p53 cells the induction of apoptosis upon
treatment with RITA is due to the inhibition of interaction
between p53 and its negative p53 regulators MDM2 and
MDMX.

Apoptosis induced by RITA is p53-dependent
To assess whether apoptosis induced by RITA is p53 dependent,
we used 2 different approaches. First, we silenced
p53 either by stably expressing p53shRNA in SHEP and
SKN-DZ cells or by transient depletion of mutant p53 in
SKN-BE(2) cells by pSUPER shp53 transfection. The silencing
of p53 prevents apoptosis induction by RITA, as shown
using a short-term viability assay (Fig. 3B, top), FACS analysis
(Fig. 3C). Second, we assessed the p53 dependence
by using chemical inhibitor of p53 transcriptional function,
small molecule PFTa (36). Inhibition of p53 by PFTa
before administration of RITA protects SHEP cells from
apoptosis (Fig. 3B, bottom left). PFTa also rescued SKNBE(2)
cells carrying mutant p53 (Fig. 3B, bottom right). In
addition, as shown below, PARP cleavage in SKN-BE(2)
cells was rescued by p53 depletion. Taken together, our
results show that apoptosis induced by RITA in neuroblastoma
cell lines is triggered by p53. Thus, we set out to explore
in more detail the mechanisms of p53-induced apoptosis.

p53 induced by RITA activates the expression of its
proapoptotic targets
As expected, we observed the induction of p53 protein
levels upon treatment with RITA in all neuroblastoma cell
lines, except SKN-BE(2), carrying mutant p53 (Fig. 3D).
Moreover, p53 accumulation upon RITA treatment resulted
in the induction of p53 targets, the key proapoptotic factors
PUMA, Noxa, and Bax, as well as CDK inhibitor p21 (Fig.
3D). These data are in line with the prevention of RITAmediated
apoptosis by RNAi-mediated silencing of p53 and
the inhibitor of p53 transcriptional activity PFTa and suggest
that p53 activated by RITA is transcriptionally active.
Furthermore, according to qPCR analysis, the expression of
several p53 target genes was induced, including proapoptotic

Bax and BBC3 (encoding PUMA), as well as CDKN1A gene
encoding CDK inhibitor p21 (Fig. 3D, bottom).

p53 inhibits the expression of N-Myc and several other
oncogenic factors important for neuroblastoma
growth
Recently we reported a potent inhibition of crucial oncogenes
by p53 in vitro and in vivo upon reactivation by RITA,
which includes Mcl-1, Bcl-2, c-Myc, cyclin E, and b-catenin
(30), as well as MDM2, MDMX, and Wip1 encoded by
PPM1D (33). We found that the inhibition of oncogenes by

p53 reduces the cell’s ability to buffer proapoptotic signals
and elicits robust apoptosis (30). Thus, we decided to test
whether p53 reactivation by RITA can inhibit oncogenes
which play important role in neuroblastoma development,
including N-Myc, Wip1, Mcl-1, and Bcl-2 (3, 5–7), as well as
p53 inhibitors MDM2 and MDMX.
Analysis of protein levels of N-Myc in 3 cell lines carrying
MYCN amplification, SKN-DZ, SKN-BE(2), and IMR32,
revealed a strong downregulation of N-Myc upon RITA
(Fig. 4A, top). Downregulation of N-Myc was p53-dependent,
as evidenced by a rescue of N-Myc, albeit incomplete,

upon partial silencing of p53 in SKN-DZ cells (Fig. 4A,
bottom).
Pretreatment by MG132 rescued N-Myc level upon RITA,
suggesting that the decline of N-Myc protein is proteasome
dependent (Fig. 4B, top left). In addition, we did not detect a
decrease of N-Myc mRNA levels by qPCR (Fig. 4C, top). It
has been shown that Fbxw7 E3 ligase ubiquitinates N-Myc
and triggers its proteasomal degradation (37). Therefore, we
tested whether downregulaiton of N-Myc is dependent on
Fbxw7. Indeed, silencing of the Fbxw7 expression by shRNA
prevented N-Myc decline upon RITA (Fig. 4B, right). Moreover,
qPCR analysis showed the induction of Fbxw7 mRNA
upon RITA treatment (Fig. 4B, bottom left), in line with
Fbxw7 being the p53 target gene (30).
Furthermore, we observed the p53-dependent transcriptional
repression of AURKA gene, encoding Aurora kinase
A (Fig. 4C, top), which we recently identified as a novel p53
target gene (38). It is possible that the transcriptional
repression of AURKA encoding Aurora kinase, known to
oppose Fbxw7-mediated degradation of N-Myc (37), might
also contribute to the degradation of N-Myc upon RITA.
Moreover, in our set of neuroblastoma cell lines p53
activated by RITA triggered a potent decrease of protein
levels of several oncogenes implicated in high-risk neuroblastoma,
including Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and Wip-1 (Fig. 4C,
bottom). In addition, we observed downregulation of the
p53 inhibitor MDMX, which cooperates with MDM2 in p53
inhibition. Consistent with downregulation of MDM2 by
RITA in other cell types (39), RITA treatment triggered a
decline of MDM2 level (Fig. 4C, bottom).
Because p53 activated by RITA has been shown to be a
potent transcriptional repressor of a number of genes,
including p53 target genes Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 (30) and we
have recently found that p53 can repress PPM1D encoding
Wip1 (33), we addressed the question whether p53-
mediated downregulation of these oncogenic factors in
neuroblastoma is conferred on mRNA level. qPCR analysis
showed that the treatment of cells with RITA lead to a
decreased levels of Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and PPM1D mRNA
(Fig. 4C, top). In contrast, MDM4 and MDM2 were not
decreased (data not shown). This is in line with our published
data that p53 activated by RITA induces degradation
of MDMX in Wip1–dependent manner, along with decline
of MDM2 (33). The transcriptional repression of oncogenes
was p53 dependent, as it was rescued by the p53 inhibitor
(Fig. 4C, top) and on protein level by RNAi-mediated
silencing of p53 in wild-type and mutant p53 expressing
cells SHEP and SKN-BE(2), respectively (Fig. 4D). However,
in mutant p53 expressing SKN-BE(2) cells, N-Myc levels
were not rescued by p53 silencing (Fig. 4D, right). It is
possible that in SKN-BE(2) cells other mechanisms might
contribute to N-Myc downregulation.

Strong antitumor effect of RITA in SKN-DZ xenografts
in mice
The most rigorous test for the antitumor effect of novel
compounds which could predict their potency as possible
anticancer drugs is the assessment of their effects in vivo. To

study the effects of RITA in vivo, we used SKN-DZ xenografts
grown in SCID mice. Upon formation of palpable tumors,
we injected intraperitonealy 10 mg/kg of RITA or vehicle
twice daily. RITA treatment significantly suppressed the
growth of neuroblastoma in vivo, resulting in a 2-fold
decrease in the volume of SKN-DZ xenografts and decrease
of the weight of tumors (Fig. 5A–C, left). The substantial
reduction of tumor volume caused by RITA was not followed
by body weight loss (Fig. 5C, right), suggesting the
absence of systemic toxicity. Notably, treatment with RITA
decreased microvascular density in some tumors, probably
due to the downregulation of N-Myc, known to have strong
proangiogenic function (ref. 3; Fig. 5B). Indeed, we
observed downregulation of N-Myc, along with the p53
target antiapoptotic factor Mcl-1, in xenograft tumors treated
with RITA (Fig. 5D).

Discussion
The relapse and chemoresistance in cancers, including
neuroblastoma, is often associated with inactivation of the
p53 tumor suppressor. Elegant studies in mice show that
reinstatement of p53 causes regression of aggressive metastatic
tumors (19, 20). This makes pharmacologic rescue of
p53 an attractive strategy to combat cancer. Several compounds
are currently undergoing clinical trials: JnJ26854165
(Johnson & Johnson), PXn727 and PXn822
(Priaxon), RG7112/nutlin3a (F. Hoffmann–la Roche), and
PRIMA-1MET/Apr-246 identified by us (22). High attrition
rate of novel drugs observed during later stages of clinical
trials due to unfavorable pharmacokinetics or toxicity
demand the search for novel compounds targeting p53.
Rescue of wild-type p53 in neuroblastoma by nutlin3a
has been reported (23, 24), supporting the idea that reactivation
of p53 by small molecules could be a good strategy
to combat neuroblastoma. Nutlin3a is highly selective:
sensitivity to nutlin-3a was highly predictive of absence of
p53 mutation (25). However, recent study shows that
continuous treatment with nutlin-3a confers selective pressure
for p53 mutations, resulting in resistance (27). Moreover,
p53-mutated nutlin-3a–resistant neuroblastoma cells
display an MDR phenotype (26). Emergence of nutlin3aresistant
clones via de novo p53 mutations was observed also
in osteosarcoma and colon carcinoma (27). Expression of
mutant p53 in neuroblastoma is known to result in establishment
of a MDR phenotype (10), thus it is imperative
that anticancer drugs and/or their combinations be developed
that target both wild-type and mutant p53.
In this study, we report that the small molecule RITA
causes disruption of p53/MDM2 and MDMX complex and
induces apoptosis in a set of neuroblastoma cell lines.
However, in contrast with nutlin-3a, which does not inhibit
the growth of mutant p53-expressing neuroblastoma (23),
RITA can reactivate mutant p53 in neuroblastoma cell lines.
In our previous study we have shown that RITA binds to
the N-terminal domain of p53 and induces a conformational
change which propagates from the N-terminus to the
core and C-terminal domain. This prevents the binding to

p53 of several inhibitors, including MDM2, iASPP, Parc,
and E6-AP (28, 32). These observations imply that RITA
treatment may affect the global folding of the p53 protein
and thus might also affect the folding of mutant p53.
Indeed, we have found that a broad range of p53 mutants
were reactivated by RITA, including several hot spot

mutants (31). Taken together with this study, our results
promote the idea of developing compounds capable of
simultaneously targeting wild type and mutant p53. This
type of compounds should reduce the chance of emergence
of de novo resistance and enhance clinical success. Indeed, in
line with our data on the ability of RITA to reactivate mutant

p53 in neuroblastoma, recent study using UKF-NB-3 neuroblastoma
cells as a model does not suggest p53 mutations
being the mechanism of acquired resistance to RITA, in
contrast to nutlin3a (41). Interestingly, several p53-binding
molecules that rescue mutant p53 have been shown to
activate the function of wild-type p53 as well. These include
CDB3 (42), SCH529074 (43), CP-3139 (44), and PRIMA1MET/Apr-246
(45). At least some of them seem to inhibit
the p53/MDM2 interaction via induction of a conformational
change (43), although in most cases the mechanism
remains elusive and awaits a detailed investigation.
Amplification of the MYCN gene predicts poor prognosis
and resistance of neuroblastoma to therapy. Inhibition of
N-Myc is therefore regarded as a promising approach for the
development of targeted therapies (3). Here, we have identified
p53 as a potent inhibitor of N-Myc expression in
neuroblastoma. We found that p53 activated by RITA
induced the expression of its target Fbxw7, which has a
critical function in proteasomal degradation of the N-Myc
protein (37). Moreover, we showed that p53 represses the
transcription of the antagonist of Fbxw7-mediated degradation
of N-Myc, Aurora A (37). Aurora A is a negative
prognostic factor and a potential therapeutic target in neuroblastoma
(46), which, according to our recent study, is a
bona fide p53 target (38). In addition, RITA treatment leads
to the decrease of MDM2, which upregulates N-Myc (17).
Taken together, our data suggest that reactivation of p53 by
RITA causes inhibition of N-Myc via induction of its E3
ligase Fbxw7. This might be further facilitated by transcriptional
repression of Aurora A and inhibition of MDM2.
It is possible that additional mechanisms of N-Myc
inhibition by RITA might exist, as we did not detect N-Myc
rescue upon mutant p53 silencing in SKN-BE(2) cells. For
example, inhibition of TrxR1 by RITA might play a role (47).
We would like to note, however, that the mutant p53
silencing by 4 different RNAi constructs caused SKN-BE
(2) cell death, limiting our analysis. We speculate that the
survival of SKN-BE(2) cells might depend on mutant p53
expression, due to gain-of-function of mutant p53. This
limitation precludes a more vigorous analysis of N-Myc
regulation by p53 in SKN-BE(2) cells.
Our study reveals the ability of p53 to unleash the
transcriptional repression of several major survival factors
in neuroblastoma. Our data suggest that the repression of
Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, reducing the cancer cell’s ability to buffer
proapoptotic signal, might contribute to the robust induction
of apoptosis in neuroblastoma by pharmacologically
reactivated p53.
Another factor downregulated in neuroblastoma cells by
RITA-reactivated p53 is Wip1, encoded by the PPM1D gene
at 17q, whose gain is associated with poor prognosis in
neuroblastoma (5). Wip1 interferes with the DNA damage
response and p53 activation by dephosphorylating crucial
effectors, thus conferring resistance to standard treatments.
It is overexpressed in different cancers and is important
for the survival of tumor stem cells, which makes the
development of Wip1 inhibitors an attractive strategy for
therapy (48). The multitude of oncogenes, inhibited by

RITA-reactivated p53 creates a robust p53 response. It might
allow p53 to cope with the daunting challenge of anticancer
therapy–multiple genetic abnormalities in individual cancers.
Because tumors are often "addicted" to the oncogenes,
such as increased expression of N-Myc, Wip1, Aurora A, Bcl2,
orMcl-1, their inhibitionmight be an essential component
of anticancer therapies targeting p53. Thus, the ability of
reactivated p53 to inhibit several key oncogenes in neuroblastoma
adds a new dimension to the mechanism of tumor
suppression upon p53 activation by small molecules.
RITA efficiently inhibited the growth of neuroblastoma
tumor xenografts without the apparent toxicity. Notably,
the morphology of tumors suggests that reactivation of p53
by RITA is able to inhibit the growth of tumors’ blood
vessels, in line with inhibition of potent proangiogenic
factor N-Myc and previous studies suggesting that p53 can
affect the transcription of several genes involved in angiogenesis
(49). The effect of RITA on tumor blood vessels is
very interesting and will be investigated further. Although
we did not attempt to maximize the therapeutic response
in vivo, it is conceivable that the dosing regimen and the
schedule of treatment could be improved, for example, by
the administration of higher dose (50–100 mg/kg, shown
previously to be safe in mice; ref. 50).
In conclusion, we showed that RITA is efficient and
potent activator of both wild-type and mutant p53 and
inducer of p53-dependent apoptosis in neuroblastoma
in vitro and in vivo. Ablation of oncogenes driving neuroblastoma,
in particularly, N-Myc, by pharamacologicaly
reactivated p53 might be a very important factor for future
application of p53-based therapy in neuroblastoma. Our
study provides further support for the notion of using
molecules reactivating p53 to combat neuroblastoma.
