Abstract
MYC regulates a myriad of genes controlling cell proliferation, metabolism, differentiation, and apoptosis.
MYC also controls the expression of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair genes and therefore may be a
potential target for anticancer therapy to sensitize cancer cells to DNA damage or prevent genetic instability.
In this report, we studied whether MYC binds to DSB repair gene promoters and modulates cell survival
in response to DNA-damaging agents. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies showed that MYC associates
with several DSB repair gene promoters including Rad51, Rad51B, Rad51C, XRCC2, Rad50, BRCA1, BRCA2,
DNA-PKcs, XRCC4, Ku70, and DNA ligase IV. Endogenous MYC protein expression was associated with
increased RAD51 and KU70 protein expression of a panel of cancer cell lines of varying histopathology. Induction
of MYC in G0-G1 and S-G2-M cells resulted in upregulation of Rad51 gene expression. MYC knockdown
using small interfering RNA (siRNA) led to decreased RAD51 expression but minimal effects on homologous
recombination based on a flow cytometry direct repeat green fluorescent protein assay. siRNA to MYC
resulted in tumor cell kill in DU145 and H1299 cell lines in a manner independent of apoptosis. However,
MYC-dependent changes in DSB repair protein expression were not sufficient to sensitize cells to mitomycin
C or ionizing radiation, two agents selectively toxic to DSB repair–deficient cells. Our results suggest that
anti-MYC agents may target cells to prevent genetic instability but would not lead to differential radiosensitization
or chemosensitization. Cancer Res; 70(21); 8748–59. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction

MYC is a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription
factor that dimerizes with its binding partner MAX
and associates with gene promoters containing the E-box
motifs CACGTG or CACATG to induce gene transcription
(1). MYC controls a broad spectrum of functions including
proliferation and cell cycle, differentiation, sensitization to
apoptotic stimuli, and genetic instability (1). These functions
are deregulated in most human cancers by a variety of
mechanisms including gene amplification, insertional mutations,
or chromosomal translocation of the myc gene. This
central role in oncogenesis makes MYC a promising target
for stand-alone molecular cancer therapies in cells undergoing
oncogene addiction (2). Recent data from Soucek and
colleagues (3) have shown that MYC inhibition in a preclinical
mouse model of RAS-induced lung adenocarcinoma
using a reversible, systemic expression of a MYC mutant that
antagonizes MYC activity triggered apoptosis and regression
of lung tumors. MYC inhibition exerted profound growth
arrest in normal tissues, which were well tolerated (3). This
study suggested that targeting MYC could maintain the therapeutic
ratio of cancer treatment by preferential killing of
tumor cells relative to normal cells. Indeed, anti-MYC agents
such as antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNA
(siRNA), or phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers
(PMO) have been developed to induce tumor cell growth
arrest, differentiation, or apoptosis (4–7).
Previous studies have indicated the association of MYC
with the promoters of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair
genes Nbs1, Ku70, Rad51, BRCA2, Rad50, Rad54L, and DNAPKcs
(8–11) and the expression of mismatch repair genes
(12–14). DSBs are repaired by two major pathways: homologous
recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining
(NHEJ). HR predominates during S and G2 phases, as it uses
sister chromatid in a template-guided manner to repair the
DNA break (15). HR relies on the function of RAD51 and its
paralogs RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, XRCC2, and XRCC3,
as well as BRCA1 and BRCA2 (15). HR-deficient cells are
particularly sensitive to the DNA cross-linking agent mitomycin
C (MMC). In contrast, NHEJ does not require strand
homology and is considered error prone, and it predominates
across all phases of the cell cycle. NHEJ requires the action
of KU70, KU80, DNA-PKcs, DNA ligase IV, and XRCC4.

NHEJ-deficient cells are in turn sensitive to ionizing radiation
(IR; ref. 15). Inhibition of MYC-regulated DNA repair could
sensitize tumor cells by inducing genetic instability and
mitotic catastrophe. Additionally, if MYC regulation of DSB
repair gene expression altered chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity,
using combinations of MYC inhibitors with DNAdamaging
agents could be beneficial. However, few studies
have combined molecular targeting of MYC with now standard
treatments such as radiochemotherapy or chemotherapy
and determined long-term clonogenic cell survival.
Given that MYC promotes genetic instability and has a potential
role in DNA repair, we determined whether MYC inhibition
leads to decreased DSB repair protein expression
and sensitization of tumor cells to IR or MMC (two agents
that are selectively toxic to NHEJ- or HR-deficient cancer
cells). We show that MYC occupies most DSB repair gene
promoters and regulates RAD51 expression. MYC knockdown
alone results in loss of long-term clonogenic survival
independent of inducing apoptosis. However, partial MYC
knockdown, which allowed for colony formation assays, did
not further sensitize cells to MMC or IR.

Materials and Methods

Cell culture, generation of inducible MYC cell lines,
and siRNA tranfections
Normal human diploid fibroblasts GMO5757 (Coriell Cell
Repository, 2008) up to 13 passages were used within
6 months of purchase, and cultured as previously described
(16). DU145 and PC-3 prostate cancer cells and RKO colon
carcinoma cells were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection (2001, 2001, and 2007, respectively) and cultured
as previously described (17, 18). 22RV1 prostate cancer cells,
MCF7 breast cancer cells, Rat-1/myc cells, and DR-GFP
H1299 lung cancer cells were kind gifts from Drs. Yoni
Pinthus (2004; Juravinski Cancer Center, Hamilton, Ontario,
Canada), Fei-Fei Liu (2009) and Linda Penn (2001; both at
the Ontario Cancer Institute/Princess Margaret Hospital,
Toronto, Ontario, Canada), and Simon Powell (2004; Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY), respectively,
and were cultured as described previously (17–22).
MCF10A cells were a kind gift from Dr. Senthil Muthuswamy
(2003; Ontario Cancer Institute/Princess Margaret Hospital,
Toronto, Ontario, Canada) and were cultured as described
previously either in full growth medium (23) or in growth
factor withdrawal (0.05% horse serum, 10 μg/mL insulin) to
downregulate endogenous MYC. Each cell line was reauthenticated
by short tandem repeat (STR) analyses performed by
The Centre for Applied Genomics, The Hospital for Sick Children
(Toronto, Ontario, Canada; June to September 2010),
with the exception of RKO, Rat-1/myc, and GMO5757, which
lack available STR profiles. The latter cell lines were authenticated
by multiple gene expression analyses and comparative
genomic hybridization. All cells were tested and found
to be Mycoplasma-free during experiments.
Inducible pF vector control and pF-MYC cell lines were
generated using the 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT)–inducible

lentiviral expression system as described previously (24).
In the presence of 4-OHT, the GEV16 transcription factor
controlled by the Ub promoter (GEV16-Gal4 DNA-binding
domain, estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain, and
VP16 transactivation domain) translocates to the nucleus,
binds the 5xUAS, and activates transcription of the gene of
interest (24). Briefly, lentiviruses were first generated in
293TV cells. Cells were then infected with viral supernatants
in the presence of 0.8 μg/mL polybrene. Forty-eight hours
after infection, stable cell pools were selected in 200 μg/mL
hygromycin and 1 μg/mL puromycin.
Cells were transfected with Validated Stealth Select RNAi
siRNA MYC duplexes 1 or 2 at a concentration of 10 nmol/L
in Opti-MEM, or with RAD51 duplexes 1 and 2 at 0.25 nmol/L,
or with Stealth RNAi Negative Universal Control using
Lipofectamine 2000 (all from Invitrogen) as previously
described (17).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP) were performed
essentially as previously described (25) with the following
modifications. Nuclei were isolated in 5 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 8.0), 85 mmol/L KCl, 0.5% NP40, and 1× protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche). Pelleted nuclei were lysed in 50 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mmol/L EDTA, 1% SDS, and 1× protease
inhibitor cocktail. Chromatin was sheared to 0.2- to 1.5-kb
fragments using a Bioruptor sonicator (Diagenode). Immunoprecipitations
were performed in 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton
X-100, 1.2 mmol/L EDTA, 16.7 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0),
167 mmol/L NaCl, and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail using
the MYC N-262 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit
IgG control (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) with
protein A/G beads (Pierce) blocked in 1% bovine serum
albumin. DNA was purified using a PCR Purification kit
(Qiagen). Immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified using
PCR primers (see Supplementary Table S1) Rad51 (9), BRCA1
(26), CAD (carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2), and Chr22
(chromosome 22; ref. 9).

Western blotting
Cells were lysed directly in boiling 2× SDS buffer [2%
SDS, 178 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4.5% glycerol]. Protein
expression was detected and quantified using primary antibodies
MYC (9E10), RAD51 (H-92), KU70 (A-9), and ATM
(2C1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), cyclin D1 (Ab-3; Oncogene),
RB (retinoblastoma protein; Pharmingen), α-tubulin
(AB-1; Calbiochem), and β-actin (Sigma) and IRDye secondary
antibodies with Odyssey IR Imaging System (LI-COR
Biosciences).

Reverse transcription and real-time quantitative PCR
RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). cDNA
was synthesized using the High Capacity cDNA Archive
kit (Applied Biosystems). Real-time quantitative PCR was
performed in triplicates using the Taqman Gene Expression
Assays on a StepOnePlus real-time quantitative PCR instrument
(Applied Biosystems). Analysis was performed using
the comparative Ct value method.

Cell cycle analysis and fluorescence-activated
cell sorting
For cell cycle analysis, cells were treated with 10 μmol/L
5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd; Sigma) in culture medium
for 1 hour. FITC-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody-labeled
(BD Biosciences) and propidium iodide (PI)–stained cells
were analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and CellQuest
Pro software (BD Biosciences) as previously described
(27). GMO5757 cell cycle profiles were obtained using PI
staining. For cell sorting, MYC expression was induced with
4-OHT for 16 hours in pF-MYC MCF10A cells. Cells were
detached by trypsin (Invitrogen) digestion and stained with
10 μg/mL Hoechst 33342 in medium lacking phenol red and
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 90 minutes at
37°C. Cells were sorted into G0-G1 and S-G2-M pools using
the MoFlo XDP cell sorter (Beckman Coulter).

Clonogenic survival and apoptosis assays
siRNA-transfected DU145 or H1299 cells were trypsinized after
48 hours and subsequently treated either with 0.5 μg/mL
MMC for 1 hour or with 2 Gy IR. Cells were plated in triplicates.
The DNA-PKcs inhibitor Ku-0057788 (KuDOS Pharmaceuticals)
was used at 1 μmol/L for 1 hour before 2 Gy IR, and
medium was changed 16 hours later. For all assays, cells were
fixed and stained in 1% methylene blue in 50% ethanol 10 to
15 days later. Surviving clones with >50 cells were scored under
a light microscope, and resulting survival was calculated
as previously described (27, 28). For apoptosis assays, H1299
cells (or Rat-1/myc controls) were treated with 0.5 μg/mL
MMC for 1 hour or with 2 or 10 Gy IR at 48 hours after siRNA
transfection and assessed for sub-G1 populations by flow
cytometry or nuclear apoptotic bodies, as previously
described (21).

HR assay
HR was assessed using a direct repeat green fluorescent
protein (DR-GFP) assay essentially as previously described
(17). These H1299 cells possess an integrated DR-GFP construct,
whose expression is prevented by an insert with the
I-SceI restriction site in the reading frame, whereby transfection
of I-SceI endonuclease creates a DSB, which when
repaired by error-free HR leads to GFP-expressing cells
(19, 29). Briefly, H1299 cells were transiently transfected with
either the negative control phCMV-1 I-SceI, the functional
endonuclease pCMV3xnlsI-SceI, or pGFP (as control for
transfection efficiency) together with control, MYC, or
RAD51 siRNA. Cells were trypsinized 72 hours after transfection
and assessed for GFP expression with FACSCalibur flow
cytometer and CellQuest Pro software. The percentage
of GFP-positive cells in 50,000 to 100,000 events was normalized
to the negative control and corrected for transfection
efficiency. There were no significant differences in transfection
efficiencies between treatments.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way ANOVA
and Tukey's multiple comparison test or a nonlinear curve
fit using the Prism 5 software (GraphPad), with P < 0.05 considered
significant. Data derived from multiple independent
experiments are shown as mean ± SE.

Results

Previous ChIP studies completed by our group showed
that MYC can bind the Rad51 gene promoter (9). We therefore
determined whether MYC also binds to other DSB repair
gene promoters involved in HR or NHEJ (30–32). In silico
analyses were performed on sequences spanning from
10 kb upstream to 3 kb downstream of selected DSB repair
gene transcription start sites (33). This revealed that there
were candidate MYC-binding sites in other DSB repair
gene promoter regions (Fig. 1A). To show these interactions
in vivo using ChIP, we used the prostate cancer cell lines
22RV1, PC-3, and DU145, given our previous publication on
their relative HR and NHEJ repair gene expression (34). We
focused on candidate sequences nearest to the transcription
start sites (Fig. 1A). MYC was found to associate with the
majority of the tested HR gene promoters, including Rad51,
Rad51B, Rad51C, XRCC2, Rad50, BRCA1, and BRCA2 (Fig. 1A;
refs. 9–11). Two primer pairs flanking the two most proximal
target sequences of XRCC3 showed weak or no enhanced
signal over the negative controls, indicating that MYC was
not associated with this promoter region (Fig. 1A). Candidate
MYC target sites in NHEJ gene promoters DNA-PKcs, XRCC4,
Ku70, and DNA ligase IV were all occupied by MYC (Fig. 1A;
refs. 10, 11). An E-box motif, not associated with MYC target
genes on Chr22, was used as a negative control (Fig. 1A;
ref. 9). We conclude that MYC can endogenously occupy
the promoters of the majority of the DSB repair genes in
asynchronously growing cancer cell lines.
Next, we compared the protein expression levels of MYC
and two MYC-occupied targets (RAD51 and KU70) in a panel
of cell lines with varying histopathology. Endogenous MYC
protein expression was associated with increased RAD51
and KU70 protein levels (Fig. 1B). To assess the correlation
of MYC and DSB repair protein levels in nontransformed
cells, we serum starved normal human fibroblasts
GMO5757 and followed MYC and DSB repair protein expression
following serum add back and subsequent cell cycle
progression. As expected, MYC protein was negligible in
G0-G1 cells, but rapidly increased following addition of serum
(Fig. 1C; Supplementary Fig. S1). RAD51 was induced on cell
cycle progression following cyclin D1 expression (Fig. 1C;
Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 35). These results are consistent
with previous observations that MYC and RAD51 protein
levels increase with an increase in S-phase fraction (35, 36).
To assess whether MYC is sufficient to activate the expression
of DSB repair genes in nontransformed human cells, we
generated a stable GEV16-inducible pF-MYC MCF10A cell
line (see Materials and Methods; ref. 24). MCF10A cells were
grown in medium containing reduced growth factors to
downregulate the high levels of endogenous MYC and to
dissociate the biological effects of endogenous and 4-OHT–
induced exogenous MYC. MYC induction in growth factor–
starved cells was sufficient to induce Rad51 gene expression
after 8 hours (Fig. 2A), whereas RAD51 protein expression

was upregulated after 16 hours (Fig. 2B). MYC induction also
resulted in a modest upregulation of Rad51C, whereas it had
little effect on NHEJ gene expression (Fig. 2A). RB phosphorylation
status and cell cycle analyses showed that induction
of MYC was associated with S-phase entry only after 16 hours
after induction (Fig. 2C). In contrast, Rad51 gene expression
increased at 8 hours before S-phase progression (Fig. 2A

and C). To further eliminate cell cycle bias, we flow sorted
pF-MYC cells into G0-G1 and S-G2-M pools followed by protein
and RNA analyses. MYC was upregulated in both G0-G1
and S-G2-M phases after 16 hours of induction (Fig. 2D),
and RAD51 could be induced in G0-G1 cells and was already
increased in S-G2-M cells, independent of MYC (Fig. 2D).
Cyclin A2 mRNA controls were selectively induced in S-G2-M

(Fig. 2D; ref. 37). Collectively, these data indicated that MYC
can regulate Rad51 gene and protein expression in G0-G1
nontransiting cells and during G1 to S cell cycle progression;
additional factors in addition to MYC may control Rad51
expression in S phase.
To determine if MYC occupancy of the Rad51 promoter
was functionally important in cells with downregulated
MYC, we characterized the level of MYC and DSB repair gene
promoter binding and protein expression following siRNA to
MYC. We used DU145 and H1299 cell lines, which express
low and high endogenous MYC, respectively, and have detectable
endogenous levels of RAD51 protein (see Fig. 1B).
MYC-ChIP specificity was confirmed with MYC siRNA, which

resulted in reduced MYC occupation on Rad51 and Ku70
gene promoters (Fig. 3A). CAD was used as a positive MYC
target control, whereas Chr22 was used as a negative control
(Fig. 3A; ref. 9).
Next, we determined the effect of MYC knockdown on DSB
repair protein expression. We used an optimal siRNA concentration
such that MYC protein levels were reduced to
its greatest extent and the control siRNA had the least toxicity
(data not shown). MYC siRNA (10 nmol/L) resulted in 60%
to 90% reduction of MYC expression and in reduced RAD51
protein levels in DU145 and H1299 cells (Figs. 3B, 5, and 7). In
contrast, KU70 protein levels were changed minimally
by similar treatment (Fig. 3B), consistent with the lack of

MYC-Regulated DSB Repair Genes and Cell Kill

MYC-dependent Ku70 expression (Fig. 2A). Next, using the
same conditions of MYC siRNA, cell cycle distribution was
determined. MYC knockdown resulted in a nonsignificant
increase in G1 fraction in DU145 cells at 24 and 48 hours,
and in an inhibition of S-phase progression in H1299 (Fig. 3C).
However, we observed reduced proliferation of MYC knockdown
DU145 cells in growth assays at later time points (Supplementary
Fig. S2). We conclude that MYC-dependent reduction
in RAD51 expression is not solely a consequence of a G1 arrest
and that MYC knockdown directly inhibits RAD51, but not
KU70, protein expression.

Given the effect of MYC on RAD51 expression, we next
performed colony-forming assays to investigate whether
modifying MYC or RAD51 would affect long-term clonogenic
cell survival based on inhibited RAD51 expression. The survival
of DU145 or H1299 cells was not significantly affected
by control siRNA transfection (data not shown). We observed
decreased cell survival by 65% in DU145 cells and by 77% in
H1299 cells following MYC siRNA (Fig. 4A and B). In contrast,
RAD51 knockdown resulted in 55% reduced survival in
DU145, but did not affect survival in H1299 cells (Fig. 4A
and B). The combination of MYC and RAD51 knockdown

siRNA and plated for colony-forming assays 48 h after treatment. MYC siRNA reduced both surviving cell colony number and size. C, apoptosis was
assessed in H1299 cells transfected as in B. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with MMC and 2 or 10 Gy IR. Left, apoptotic morphology
was determined 72 h after DNA damage using Hoechst 33342 staining; right, sub-G1 cell populations were assessed 72 h after DNA damage using

resulted in a trend toward additive cell kill in both cell lines
(Fig. 4A and B). In addition to reducing the number of surviving
cells, MYC siRNA led to smaller surviving colony sizes
in both cell lines (Fig. 4A and B). This suggests inhibited
growth rate and/or postmitotic cell death of the daughter
cells within a colony, and is consistent with DU145 reduced
growth rate (Supplementary Fig. S2). MYC downregulation
has previously been shown to promote apoptosis (3, 12),
and given that siRNA to MYC was more toxic in H1299 cells,
we determined whether apoptosis was the mode of cell death
in this cell system (Fig. 4C). MYC knockdown alone or combined
with DSB-inducing agents did not induce apoptosis as
measured by nuclear morphology (Hoechst 33342 staining)
or sub-G1 peak analysis (flow cytometry; Fig. 4C) compared
with the positive control, Rat-1/myc cells (Supplementary
Fig. S3). This indicates that cell death following siRNA to
MYC can involve modes of cell death other than apoptosis,
as previously documented in irradiated prostate cancer cell
lines (21).
MMC causes intrastrand DNA cross-links that lead to collapsing
replication forks and generation of DSBs that are typically
repaired by HR (38). We performed colony-forming
assays using a combination of MYC siRNA and MMC to
see whether MYC knockdown cells were sensitive to HRspecific
agent. An average of 70% knockdown of MYC expression
in DU145 cells led to 40% reduction in RAD51, but this
was not sufficient to enhance MMC toxicity (Fig. 5A). Consistent
with this observation, an average of 80% MYC knockdown
in MMC-treated H1299 cells did not result in further
cell kill (Fig. 5B). In contrast, RAD51 knockdown resulted
in significant MMC sensitivity in both cell lines (Fig. 5). These
observations suggest that RAD51, but not MYC, plays a role
in the cellular MMC sensitivity of tumor cell clonogens.
Additionally, we performed DR-GFP assays (17) that
directly measure HR function (see Materials and Methods;
Fig. 6A) to ascertain MYC involvement in functional HR.
H1299 cells were cotransfected with the I-SceI endonuclease
and either control, MYC, or RAD51 siRNA. Cells were harvested
72 hours after transfection to allow sufficient recombination
to occur. Whereas RAD51 knockdown reduced HR
by 85%, MYC knockdown decreased HR by only 14% (Fig. 6B
and C). This was independent of cell cycle following siRNA
treatment (Fig. 3C). The mild effect of MYC inhibition on
HR may therefore explain the lack of MMC-induced cell kill
in MYC knockdown cells.
Finally, we investigated the role of MYC knockdown in cell
kill following DSBs induced by IR. Cells deficient in HR or
NHEJ will be sensitized to IR treatment (15). Neither

DU145 nor H1299 cells exhibited sensitization to a clinically
relevant dose of 2 Gy following MYC knockdown (Fig. 7).
This is in contrast to the profound radiosensitization of the
same cells through inhibition of the NHEJ protein, DNA-PKcs
(Supplementary Fig. S4). RAD51 knockdown led to radiosensitization
in H1299, but not in DU145, cells (Fig. 7), consistent
with the variable IR sensitivity of HR-deficient cells (15).
These results indicate that MYC knockdown does not lead
to cellular radiosensitization.

Discussion

Previous ChIP array studies have shown the association of
MYC to several DSB repair promoters (9–11), and we now
report the novel findings that MYC directly transactivates
Rad51 and associates with the Ku70 promoter with little effect
on KU70 expression. The MYC-dependent differential
regulation of HR versus NHEJ proteins is unknown, but
may be a result of differential translational control and protein
half-life (17). We also observed that knockdown of MYC
leads to inhibition of RAD51, a central factor in HR. Yet, this
downregulation was not sufficient to sensitize cells to DNAdamaging
agents such as MMC and IR, which preferentially
kill HR-deficient cells. MYC has been estimated to regulate
10% to 15% of human genes (10, 11, 33). Global MYC ChIP

array data combined with gene expression data revealed that
a vast majority of MYC-associated targets did not change
expression following ectopic MYC expression in B cells (33).
It has also been speculated that MYC amplification in tumor
cells may bind low-affinity E boxes that would be out of its
physiologic target range in normal cells (10, 33, 39). Together,
these data show the importance of comparing gene and protein
expression data with functional assays to ascertain the
cell biology associated with MYC promoter binding.
Our results show that under conditions that allow sufficient
cell proliferation and clonogenic potential, 60% to
80% reduction of MYC levels alone caused substantial cell
death. Targeting MYC by overexpression, antisense, siRNA,
inhibitors, or a dominant-interfering MYC mutant can induce
apoptosis and growth delay, resulting in tumor regression
(2, 3, 40, 41). However, whereas apoptosis does not
necessarily affect long-term cell survival (21), fewer studies
have shown the effect of MYC inhibition in cellular radiosensitization
or chemosensitization in colony-forming survival
assays. As such, the 65% to 77% cell kill we observed following
MYC siRNA was not explained by apoptotic cell death, as
MYC siRNA alone or its combination with MMC or IR did not
induce apoptosis. Additionally, MYC-addicted tumor cells
can differentiate, senesce, or cease to proliferate on MYC inactivation
(42), and highlight the importance of assessing the

efficacy of possible therapeutic applications using longterm
clonogenic potential. There are inconsistent conclusions
from studies comparing cellular sensitivity with
MYC depletion or overexpression, and the outcome may
be cell type dependent. Studies have reported NHEJ repair,
mismatch repair, and disparate chemotherapy-induced
apoptosis or proliferation in the context of both increased
and decreased MYC expression in differing tumor cell lines
(12, 43–46). We conclude that attempts to combine MYCrelated
effects in DSB repair gene expression with chemotherapy
or radiotherapy may not lead to sensitization of
tumor clonogens.
Reducing RAD51 expression by 80-90% resulted in MMC
and IR sensitivity in H1299 cells and in MMC sensitivity in
DU145 cells. RAD51 is overexpressed in several cancers,
and increased levels of RAD51 correlate with increased erroneous
recombination and resistance to DNA-damaging
agents (47). Given that HR-deficient cells are sensitive to
therapies such as MMC, cisplatin, and IR, targeting RAD51
and thereby inhibiting HR is a potential target for combined
therapies. For example, imatinib leads to decreased RAD51
expression. Combining imatinib with IR resulted in decreased
clonogenic survival in vitro, as well as in tumor growth delay
in PC-3 prostate cancer xenografts (28). Hence, directly targeting
the key players in HR may provide a potent tool for
tumor cell radiosensitization, given that indirect HR targeting
through MYC did not lead to enhanced sensitivity.

In conclusion, our work suggests that although MYC occupies
the majority of DSB repair promoters and controls
RAD51 expression, MYC downregulation by siRNA is not sufficient
to induce cellular radiosensitivity and MMC sensitivity.
However, MYC depletion can lead to cell death directly. Small
molecules and PMO as single agents that are not limited by
transfection-based methods should be further assessed, as
such a strategy may directly target cell proliferation, tumor
progression, and genetic instability.
