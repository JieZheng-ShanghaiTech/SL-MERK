Background: MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate post-transcriptional mRNA expression by binding
to 3′ untranslated region (3′-UTR) of the complementary mRNA sequence resulting in translational repression
and gene silencing. They act as negative regulators of gene expression and play a pivotal role in regulating
apoptosis and cell proliferation. Studies have shown that miRNAs interact with p53 by regulating the activity
and function of p53 through direct repression or its regulators. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an
evolutionary conserved check point protein kinase that plays a major effect in the control of cell division via protein
synthesis regulation. mTOR regulates protein synthesis through phosphorylation and inactivation of 4E-BP1
and through phosphorylation and activation of S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). These two downstream effectors of mTOR
control cell growth and metabolism. In mammals, mTOR protein kinase is the central node in the nutrient and
growth factor signaling and p53 plays a critical role in sensing genotoxic stress. Activation of p53 inhibits
mTOR activity, which in turn regulates its downstream targets providing a cross talk among both the signaling
machinery. MicroRNA-15 and 16 belong to a common precursor family and are highly conserved. Deletion or
downregulation of these two microRNAs has been shown to accelerate cell division by modulating the expression
of the genes involved in controlling cell cycle progression. These microRNAs may function as tumor suppressors
and act on the downstream targets of p53 signaling pathway. To have a better insight of the role of miR-15/16 in
regulating the cross talk of p53 and mTOR, we performed an in depth study in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells
by performing a gain-of-function analysis with lentiviral plasmids expressing microRNA-15 and 16.
Methods: The effect of individual microRNAs on RPS6KB1 was examined by using 3′-UTR clones via luciferase
based assays. The cell cycle effects were observed by flow-cytometric analysis. Reverse transcription PCR was
used to explore the expression of mTOR and RPS6KB1 in cells transfected with miR-15/16.
Results: Overexpression of miR-15/16 led to inhibition of cell proliferation causing G1 cell cycle arrest as well as
caspase-3 dependent apoptosis. Forced expression of miR-15/16 might lead to decrease in mRNA level of
RPS6KB1, mTOR. The effect was a complete reversal after treatment with anti-miRs against miR-15/16 proving
the specificity of the expression. In addition, the dual luciferase reporter assays indicated a clear decrease in luciferase
gene expression in cells transfected with lentiviral based miR-15 and 16 plasmids indicating that miR15/16
directly targets RPS6KB1 through its 3′-UTR binding. Further, these microRNAs also inhibit epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT) by targeting key proteins such as Twist1 and EZH2 clearly demonstrating its
crucial role in controlling cell proliferation.
Conclusion: This study suggests that exogenous microRNA-15/16 can target RPS6KB1, control cell proliferation
and cause apoptosis in caspase-dependent manner even in the absence of functional p53.

mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously expressed small
non-coding RNAs that play a regulatory role in post-transcriptional
gene products (Hwang and Mendell, 2006). miRNA binds with 3′UTR
of target mRNAs leading to its degradation and translational repression.
Aberrant expression of miRNA is observed in various human tumors.
Studies have also shown that regulation of the expression of specific
miRNAs could serve as an additional mechanism for tumor suppression.
Therefore, targeted therapies that use microRNAs to stop metastasis
may be an effective approach to treat cancer.
Genome instability is a hallmark for cancer. One of the major mechanisms
for controlling tumorigenesis is to inhibit mTOR signaling by
several check point proteins. S6 Kinase 1 (S6K1) is a major mTOR downstream
signaling molecule that regulates fundamental cellular processes
including transcription, translation, protein and lipid synthesis, cell
growth, size and cell metabolism (Magnuson et al., 2012). Several isoforms
of S6K1 are overexpressed in breast cancer cell lines and tumors.
S6K1 gene (RPS6KB1) is located in human chromosome 17q23, a region
that is amplified in 20% of primary breast cancers (Courjal and Theillet,
1997; Kim et al., 2009), non-small cell lung cancer (Zhang et al., 2013),
HCC patients (Li et al., 2012), HIV/EBV+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
(Zhao et al., 2013), and gastric cancer (Sun et al., 2014) and is associated
with poor prognosis. Studies by Lai et al. (2010) have revealed that the
mTOR-S6K1 was found to be a novel regulator of p53 in DNA damage response
and plays a key role in tumorigenesis (Lai et al., 2010). It is reported
that microRNAs regulate cell growth and apoptosis in which
miRNAs themselves function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors
(Cheng et al., 2005). MicroRNA-15 family includes six highly conserved
miRNAs (miR-15a, miR-15b, miR-16-1, miR-16-2, miR-195, miR-497)
that are clustered on three separate chromosomes (Porrello et al.,
2011). Deletion of miR-15a/16-1 accelerates cell growth through modulation
of cell cycle proteins such Cyclin E and Cyclins D1, D3 and Cdk6
involving E2F (Calin et al., 2002;Wang et al., 2009; Lerner et al., 2009). It
has been reported that miR-15 and miR-16 are regulated by p53
(Brosh et al., 2008; Suzuki et al., 2009; Boominathan, 2010). Since
E2F1 activates p53 via numerous pathways (Polager and Ginsberg,
2009), it is possible that E2F1 regulation of miR-15 and miR-16 expression
is mediated by p53. Studies by Klein et al. (2010) have
demonstrated that these microRNAs negatively regulate Bcl2 oncogene,
modulate proliferation and promote apoptosis. Till date,
there is no report of its role in understanding the mechanism of action
in the signaling pathway. Thus understanding the link of both
these miRNAs in regulating the major signaling players of ATM
check point pathway with respect to p53 may enable to develop better
therapeutics. Reports on drug discovery have indicated that
mTOR inhibitors have limited success (Sridharan and Basu, 2011).
The role of miR-15/16 in breast cancer targeting RPS6KB1 has not
been reported. Here, in this study we examined the effects of miR15/16
on RPS6KB1 gene regulation and its action on cell proliferation
and apoptosis.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Cell culture

Human breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231), lung cancer
cells (A549), cervical cancer cells (HeLa), neuroblastoma (IMR-32, SKN-SH,
Neuro-2a) were purchased from American Type culture collection
centre. MCF-7, A549, HeLa, IMR-32 were maintained in Dulbecco's
modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen), supplemented with
2 mM glutamax (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum and 100 U/ml penicillin
and 100 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Sigma). EMEM was used for
growing SK-N-SH and Neuro-2a cell lines and RPMI was used for
MDA-MB-231 cells. All cell lines were grown on 60 mm cell culture
dishes and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing
5% CO2 in the incubator.

2.2. Cloning of 3′-UTR of RPS6KB1

RNA was isolated from MCF7 cell line using Trizol-Chloroform
(Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized using Invitrogen SuperScript® III
by following manufacturer's protocol. Platinum® Taq DNA Polymerase
having high Fidelity was used for PCR (Thermo scientific). 3′-UTR region
of p70S6K1 (NCBI Reference Sequence: NM_003161.2) containing
full length as well as partial1 (P1) and partial 2 (P2) was cloned in
psiCheck2 vector (Promega) using XhoI and NotI restriction enzymes.
Full length (FL) region comprises of 3439 bp, and partial 1 (P1) and partial
2 (P2) are 1213 bp and 1562 bp respectively. Primers used for cloning
were listed in Table 2.

2.3. Luciferase activity assay

Cells were seeded in 6 well plates 24 h prior to transfection.
Co-transfection of plasmid DNAs (i.e. 2 μg of 3′-UTR constructs of
RPS6KB1 cloned in psiCHECK2 vector and 2 μg lentiviral based
microRNA expression plasmids [miR-15, miR-16, miR-17], System Biosciences)
was performed using lipofectamine 2000. Luciferase assays
were performed 48 h after transfection using dual luciferase assay substrate
(Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to renilla luciferase
activity for each transfected well. Here the ratio of F/R readings
will provide the expression of particular gene in microRNA transfected
cells. Three independent experiments were performed in triplicate.

2.4. P53 siRNA transfection

P53 siRNA (Dharmacon) transfection was performed by the Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX transfection reagent following the manufacturer's
method. Briefly MCF-7 cells were plated in 6-well plates at density of
1, 00,000/well and transfected with p53 siRNA at a final concentration
of 25 nM in serum/antibiotic free media. Scrambled siRNA was used as
control. After 6 h of transfection, the media was replaced with complete
growth media following which the cells were allowed to recover for
48 h and assayed for microRNA expression using microRNA specific
primers obtained from kit [RA-610A-1-System Biosciences].

2.5. P53 overexpression study

Briefly MDA-MB-231 cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of
1, 00,000/well and transfected with p53 overexpression plasmid (2 μg
of CMV-p53) or vector in serum/antibiotic free media. After 6 h of transfection,
the media was replaced with complete growth media following
which the cells were allowed to recover for 48 h. Cells were extracted 48 h
after transfection and then the RNA isolated was used for microRNA and
gene expression studies.

2.6. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR)

Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and reverse
transcribed into cDNA using superscript II reverse transcriptase

(Invitrogen). PCR was carried out with specific primers against mTOR,
RPS6KB1, EZH2, Twist1, GAPDH genes in PCR machine (Takara Biosciences).
The primers used are listed in Table 1. GAPDH was used as a loading
control. The products were electrophoresed on agarose gel (1%)
followed by staining with ethidium bromide and visualized under U.V.
light. The signal intensity of respective bands was measured by means
of the quantity one version 4.1.1 software using BIORAD image analysis
system.

2.7. MicroRNA expression study

For microRNA expression studies, total RNA was isolated from breast
cancer lines [i.e. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231]. Equal amount of DNasetreated
RNA was Poly-A tailed using Poly(A)-Polymerase and oligodT-adapter
to synthesize the cDNA. RT-PCR reaction was set up using
universal reverse primer and miRNA specific forward primer (i.e. miR15a,
miR-15b, miR-16-1) at 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, followed
by 40 cycles of PCR (95 °C 15 s, 60 °C 1 min).

2.8. Cell viability (MTT assay)

MTT assay was performed to assess the cytotoxicity. MTT is a tetrazolium
salt taken up by the live cells and converted into a water insoluble
colored formazan dye by mitochondrial succinate reductase. The
quantity of formazan dye is directly proportional to the number of metabolically
active cells, and can be quantified by measuring the absorbance.
Briefly, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with miR-15, miR-16 overexpression
plasmids (or) control vector in 96 well plates (10,000 cells/well).
After 12 h, 24 h and 48 h of transfection, the reagent was added according
to manufacturer's recommendations and cell viability was determined by
taking optical density values at 570 nm.

2.9. Cell cycle analysis

For cell cycle analysis by flow-cytometry, 5 × 105 MDA-MB-231 cells
were seeded in 60 mm dish and allowed to grow for 24 h followed by
transfection with 2 μg of miR-15, miR-16, miR-17 plasmids (System biosciences,
vector PMIRHXXX-PA-1) that are cloned in a lentiviral based
vector. Cells were harvested with Trypsin-EDTA, fixed with ice-cold
70% ethanol at 4 °C for 30 min, washed with PBS and incubated with
1 mg/ml RNase A solution (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min. Thereafter, the
cells were collected by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min, further
stained with 250 μl of DNA staining solution [10 mg of Propidium Iodide
(PI), 0.1 mg of tri-sodium citrate, and 0.03 ml of Triton X-100 for 30 min
in the dark] and proceeded for analysis of DNA contents of 20,000
events (DAKO CYTOMATION, Beckman Coulter). Histograms of the
data obtained were made using Summit Software.

2.10. Protein extraction and immunoblot analysis

MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in complete medium. After 24 h,
they were treated for 16 h with nocadazole to synchronize the cells in
G2/M (Santra et al., 2009). Then cells were washed and placed in complete
medium. Further these cells were transfected with miR-15 and
miR-16 in 60 mm dishes. Total cell lysates were obtained by lysing the

cells with ice cold RIPA buffer (Sigma) containing protease inhibitor
(Roche). Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C.
The protein obtained from supernatant was quantified by Bradford
method (BIO-RAD) using Multimode Varioskan instrument (ThermoFisher
Scientifics). Equal amounts of protein per lane were separated
by 8–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to PVDF membrane.
The membrane was blocked in 5% skim milk for 1 h and then incubated
with a specific antibody for 2 h. The antibodies used in this study were:
antibodies to p53, caspase 3, caspase 9 (Santa Cruz), cyclin D1, cyclin E,
cdk2, cdk4, PARP, β-actin (Imgenex), p21 (Cell signaling). The specific
protein was detected by using a SuperSignal protein detection kit
(Pierce). The band density of specific proteins was quantified after normalization
with the density of β-actin.

2.11. Caspase-3 assay

Cells were plated in 6 well plates, transfected using 2 μg of lentiviral
based microRNA overexpression clones (System Biosciences). Fortyeight
hours after transfection, caspase-3 activity was measured following
the instructions of caspase-3 fluorescence assay kit (Clone tech).
The substrate used in the assay is DEVD-AFC. Cleavage of this substrate
by caspase-3 liberates AFC which can be measured at excitation wave
length of 405 nm and emission wave length of 500 nm. Here, DEVDCHO
(1 mM) was used as inhibitor in this assay.

2.12. Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using the graph pad software to
evaluate the significant difference between the control and treated
samples. All variables were tested in three independent experiments.
The results were reported as mean ± SD. * represents p-value b0.05,
** represents p-value b0.01, *** represents p-value b0.001.

3. Results

3.1. Expression of RPS6KB1 and mTOR in various cancer cell lines

The 40S ribosomal protein S6 Kinase that acts downstream of the
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays an important role in
cell proliferation, protein translation and cell survival is often elevated
in breast cancer (Barlund et al., 2000; Maruani et al., 2012). To have a
deeper understanding of the expression pattern of mTOR and
RPS6KB1 mRNAs in various cancers, we have undertaken the study in
cancer cell lines of different origins such as MDA-MB-231, MCF-7
(breast cancer), A549 (Lung cancer), HeLa (Cervical cancer), IMR-32,
SK-N-SH, Neuro-2a (neuronal cancers). These cell lines were chosen
as they differ in P53 status (wild, mutant and lack of function). RNA
was isolated and RT-PCR analysis was conducted. The expression of
mTOR and its downstream target RPS6KB1 (S6K1) was significantly elevated
in breast and lung cancer compared to other cancers. Among the
two different breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited
slightly higher levels of mTOR and RPS6KB1 mRNAs compared to
MCF-7 (Fig. 1A). mTOR contains two conserved phosphorylation sites,
threonine 2446 and serine 2448 that conform to the consensus phosphorylation
motif of the AGC family of kinases, which includes Akt,
RSK and S6K1. mTOR initiates S6K1 activation in response to cellular energy
status, nutrient levels, and mitogens. As mTOR and RPS6KB1 act in
the same pathway and are dependent on one another (i.e. activation of
mTOR activates S6K1 and vice versa), we observed a similar trend. S6K1
siRNA led to a significant inhibition of S6K1 expression, and concurrently
reduced mTOR phosphorylation, as compared to the scrambled control.
Since both threonine 2446 and serine 2448 residues in mTOR are
found to be phosphorylated by S6K1, the growth factor stimulation of
mTOR function has been correlated to the increase in phosphorylation
of serine 2448 (Holz and Blenis, 2005). In addition, S6K1 activation is
initiated by mTOR/raptor-mediated phosphorylation of T389 (Kim

et al., 2002), which requires the TOS motif located at the N terminus of
S6K1. Thus, mTOR controls S6K1 and S6K1 in turn regulates mTOR. As
mTOR and RPS6KB1 act in the same pathway and are dependent on
one another (i.e. activation of mTOR activates S6K1 and vice versa),
we observed a similar trend. Further, we examined the activity of
RPS6K1 3′-UTR as a measure of gene activity by transfecting
RPS6KB1 3′-UTR in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, A549, HeLa, IMR-32, SKN-SH,
Neuro-2a cells. The measure of luciferase activity gives the expression
of the gene activity. MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited higher
levels of UTR expression compared to other cell lines revealing
high level of expression of RPS6KB1 (Fig. 1B).

3.2. Role of p53 on expression of miR-15 and miR-16 in MDA-MB-231 cells

MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene activity.
Using bioinformatic algorithm “MicroRNA.org”, we have clearly depicted
the binding modes of miR-15/16 to the 3′-UTR of RPS6KB1 (Fig. 2). Studies
have shown that the promoters of miR-15, 16 contain p53 response
elements (p53RE). Thus, there exists a possible binding of p53 as well as
transactivation of these miR genes (Boominathan, 2010; Fabbri et al.,
2011; Merkel et al., 2010). Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated
that cancer cells contain high mTOR activity in p53-deficient tumors

(Akeno et al., 2014) and thus indicate the possible role of mTOR and
p53 in regulating the antagonistic functions of cell proliferation. Hence,
we examined the role of p53 dependent microRNAs on RPS6KB1 and
mTOR in MDA-MB-231 cell line having p53 mutant genetic background.
To see the expression of endogenous miR-15 and miR-16 on p53, we performed
reverse transcription PCR on two different breast cancer cell lines
that contained a mutant p53 (MDA-MB-231) and wild-type p53 (MCF-7).
The expression of miR-15, 16 was lower in MDA-MB-231 cells compared
to MCF-7 cells that contained wild-type p53 (Fig. 3A). To further substantiate
our finding, we assessed the influence of loss- and gain-of-function
of p53 in miR15/16 regulation. In MCF-7 cells, we performed knockdown
of p53 using three different siRNAs that specifically target p53. There was
a decrease in the levels of miR15/16 compared to control cells in which
scrambled siRNA were used (Fig. 3C; Additional Fig. 1). Simultaneously
p53 was overexpressed in MDA-MB-231 cells, using plasmid constructs.
This resulted in restoration of miR15/16 (Fig. 3B). These results suggest
that p53 is essential for the expression of miR15/16 that in turn regulates
mTOR and RPS6KB1 mRNAs (Polytarchou et al., 2012).
To confirm the results obtained that showed the possible link of
miR-15/16 in controlling mTOR and RPS6KB1 via p53, we performed
reverse experiments by transfecting MDA-MB-231 cells with miR-15
and-16 overexpression plasmids having lentiviral background. We

208 bp. (B). RPS6KB1 3′-UTR (S6K1) was transfected in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, A549, HeLa, IMR-32, Neuro2a, SK-N-SH cell lines for 48 h and the lysates were extracted with lysis buffer and
luciferase assay was conducted using these lysates. Results indicated high level of expression of UTR (expression by reporter luciferase gene) in MDA-MB-231 cells when compared with
other cell lines used in the study. Each experiment was conducted three times. P b 0.001 = ***.

compared the effect of individual microRNAs on the expression of
mRNA levels of both mTOR and RPS6KB1. Results obtained from RTPCR
analysis clearly indicated downregulation of RPS6KB1 and mTOR
compared to GAPDH expression that served as an internal control

(Fig. 3D, Additional Fig. 2). Further the effect of p53 on mTOR and
RPS6KB1 was measured by overexpressing p53 in MDA-MB-231 cells
that lack functional p53. Results indicated downregulation of mTOR
and RPS6KB1 to a considerable level (Fig. 3E).

3.3. miR-15/16 are essential for mTOR and RPS6KB1

To evaluate whether transfected miR-15/16 are essential for both
mTOR and RPS6KB1, we performed luciferase-based reporter assay.
MDA-MB-231 cells were co-transfected with full length and partial
(P1) RPS6KB1 3′-UTR-luciferase reporter plasmids with individual
microRNAs (miR-15/16) in order to understand the contribution of
each microRNA on RPS6KB1 3′UTR. Interestingly, miR-15 and miR-16

drastically downregulated RPS6KB1 3′UTR expression. No significant
change was observed in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with P1 UTR
that lack the binding site for miR-15 and miR-16 compared to control.
Thus, the specificity of binding of these microRNAs on RPS6KB1 was revealed
(Fig. 3F, Additional Fig. 3). The effect of these microRNAs on
RPS6KB1 was recovered to large extent to the normal levels, when
anti-miRs against the particular microRNA's (i.e. miR-15, 16) were
used in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3G).

sites of miR-15/16 (i.e. P1 construct) were used for transfection in MDA-MB-231 cells. 3′-UTR region containing intact full length miR-15 and miR-16 resulted in decrease of luciferase
gene activity when compared with control, indicating the binding ability of these microRNAs to 3′-UTR. The P1 3′-UTR construct of S6K1 has shown negligible effect upon transfection
with miR-15/16 as indicated by negligible change in luciferase values when compared with control. Each experiment was conducted three times P b 0.001 = ***, P b 0.01 = **,
P b 0.05 = *. (G). Anti-miR-15/16 were used in the study to confirm the specificity of the effect of these miRs towards RPS6KB1 was used in the study.

3.4. Effects of miR-15/16 on breast cancer cell viability

To evaluate long-term effects of miR-15/16 restoration on cell
growth analysis, MDA-MB-231 cells were plated in 24-well plates
with equal cell density. The microRNA-15 and 16 constructs were
transfected in MDA-MB-231 cells and allowed to grow for varying

time periods. Lentiviral expression of microRNA in MDA-MB-231
cells resulted in significant decrease in cell viability as shown in
Fig. 4A. Interestingly, increase in the incubation time caused increased
loss of cell viability. Here, the decrease in cell viability may
not be to the full extent due to involvement of many other miRs in
this event.

Fig. 4. The impact of miR-15/16 on cell viability and cell cycle. (A). MicroRNAs miR-15 and miR-16 (2 μg) were transfected separately in MDA-MB-231 cells and were allowed to incubate
for varying time periods (12–48 h). MTT assay was performed to see the effect on cell viability. Loss of cell viability was observed with increase in the period of incubation. Here cells
transfected with vector alone without any miR cloned was used as control. (B). MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with miR-15/16 in MDA-MB-231 cells. These cells were subjected
to FACS analysis. Results indicated G1 phase cell cycle arrest in MDA-MB-231 cells with significant number of cells undergoing apoptosis (G0). The percentage of the apoptotic cells are
represented in the form of histogram. (C). MDA-MB-231 cells were synchronized with nocodazole treatment and then cells were transfected with microRNAs such as miR-15 and
miR-16 for 48 h. The lysates obtained were used for western blot analysis against tumor suppressor proteins such as p53, p21, Cyclins (Cyclin D1, Cyclin E), Cdk (i.e. Cdk2, Cdk4) that
acts at G1-S phase of cell cycle and apoptotic proteins such as caspase-3, caspase-9 and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). (D). MDA-MB-231 transfected with microRNAs for 48 h
and the lysates obtained were subjected to caspase-3 assay. miR-15/16 transfected cells exhibited an increase in caspase-3 protein levels as observed by ELISA assay. Here inhibitor = caspase-3
inhibitor that was provided in assay kit (Clontech). Each experiment was conducted three times P b 0.001 = ***, P b 0.01 = **, P b 0.05 = *.

3.5. miR-15/16 restoration causes accumulation of cells in G1 phase and
apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells

MiR-15/MiR-16 cluster is located in the intron of “deleted in leukemia
2” (DLEU2) (Lerner et al., 2009). The validated targets of miR-15/
16 include many genes related to the control of cell cycle progression
such as cyclin D1 (Bonci et al., 2008), cyclin E (Wang et al., 2009), Bcl2
(Cimmino et al., 2005), c-Myb (Chung et al., 2008). Thus, we further
examined the cell cycle regulatory as well as apoptosis inducing nature
of these miRs in MDA-MB-231 cells by conducting flow-cytometry,
western blot and caspase assays.
As shown in Fig. 4B, the overexpression of miR-15/16 induced accumulation
of cells in G1 phase with reduction of cells in G2/M-phase;
clearly exhibited G1 cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, we also observed
an increase in the number of apoptotic cells in miR transfected cells.
This indicates that overexpression of miR-15 and miR-16 can cause
apoptosis induction in cells lacking functional p53. In order to confirm
the G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis-inducing nature by miR-15/16,
we have synchronized the cells with nocodazole followed by transfection
with miR-15 and -16. The cell lysates obtained were analyzed for
the expression of G1 cell cycle as well as apoptotic proteins. Results indicated
the decrease in the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E1, Cdk2,
Cdk4 and increased expression of p53, p21, caspase-3, caspase-9 and
PARP (Fig. 4C, D). This observation corroborated with findings of Druz
et al. (2013) and Druz et al. (2013) wherein miR-15a-3p was found to
induce apoptosis in human cancer cells.

3.6. Effect on epithelial to mesenchymal signaling

Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is known to impart metastasis
and stemness characteristics in several cancers including breast
cancer (Malouf et al., 2013). The EMT phenotype is dictated by Twist1
and polycomb group of proteins such as EZH2 (Wu and Yang, 2011).
To see whether these microRNAs have any effect on Twist1, EZH2 expression,
we transfected breast cancer cell lines and studied the mRNA
expression of the particular genes. We observed a drastic reduction in
Twist1 and EZH2 mRNA expression in miR-15/16 transfected MDAMB-231
cells. Similar results were observed in an unrelated IMR-32
neuronal cancer cells (Fig. 5, Additional Fig. 4) indicating a novel role
of microRNA-15/16 on invasion.

4. Discussion

Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer in women (Maruani
et al., 2012). Elucidation of molecular mechanisms involved in breast
cancer and its progression is vital for development of anti-cancer therapeutics.
RPS6KB1 [S6K1] is situated in 17q21-23 and 11q13, which are
overexpressed in several malignancies including breast cancer. S6K1
gene amplification as well as its protein expression was associated
with worst outcome in breast cancer. Recent studies revealed that
mTOR-S6K1 is a novel regulator of p53 during DNA damage response
and thus plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis. In addition, S6K1-
Mdm2 interaction interconnects the Mdm2-p53 and mTOR-S6K1 pathways
(Lai et al., 2010).
P53 dependent microRNAs miR-15 and miR-16 modulate the
expression of genes associated with cell cycle and oncogenesis such as cyclin
D1 (Bonci et al., 2008), cyclin E (Wang et al., 2009), Bcl-2 (Cimmino
et al., 2005), c-Myb (Chung et al., 2008) and recently E2F (Ofir et al.,
2011). Recent studies have demonstrated the role of miR-18 and miR421
in regulating the balance between mTOR and ATM (Xie and Proud,
2013). Thus there exists lot of scope to identify the crucial microRNAs
that play a role in RPS6KB1 and p53 mediated cell proliferation and apoptosis
events.
We initiated our studies by comparing the expression level of mTOR
and its downstream gene RPS6KB1 (S6K1) in various cancer cells. We
found that MDA-MB-231 cells exhibit higher levels of RPS6KB1 and
mTOR when compared with other cell lines (Fig. 1A). Further, we
have transfected the 3′-UTR of RPS6KB1 gene in various cancer cell
lines and observed the expression level by measuring the luciferase reporter
activity. Interestingly, MDA-MB-231 cells have shown tremendous
increase in RPS6KB1 (p70S6K1) 3′-UTR activity compared to
other cells lines used in the study (Fig. 1B). Our results were supported
by recent studies (Akeno et al., 2014) where in cancer cells exhibit
marked increase in S6K1 activity in p53-deficient tumors indicating
the possible role of S6K1 and p53 in regulating the antagonistic functions
of cell proliferation. The possibility of cell type dependent expression
of S6K1 also cannot be ruled out.
A Bio-informatic algorithm (i.e. www.microRNA.org) has revealed
the possible binding sites of p53 regulated tumor suppressor
microRNAs such as miR-15 and miR-16 in the 3′-UTR of S6K1 (Fig. 2).
Thus, we were interested to know about the endogenous expression
of tumor suppressor microRNAs [miR-15, miR-16] in breast cancer
cells such as MCF-7 (p53 wild-type) and MDA-MB-231 (p53 mutant)
by conducting RT-PCR analysis. It was observed that the level of expression
of these miRs is lower in MDA-MB-231 cells than MCF-7 cells
(Fig. 3A) revealing the importance of wild-type p53 for the increased
expression of miR-15 and miR-16. These observations were substantiated
by gain- and loss-of-function of p53 in MDA-MB-231(p53 mutant)
and MCF-7 (p53 wt) cell lines respectively (Fig. 3B, C). The ultimate
goal of anti-cancer therapeutics is based on their effects on cell cycle arrest
and induction of apoptosis. Thus, we were interested to understand
the possible role of these tumor suppressor microRNAs on S6K1 gene
that gets activated very often in 20% of breast cancers (Vander Hage
et al., 2004; Noh et al., 2008; Fenton and Gout, 2011). Studies have clearly
demonstrated that S6K1 activation is mediated by mTOR and in turn
mTOR gets activated by overexpression of S6K1 in breast cancers
(Bjornsti and Houghton, 2004; Jiang and Liu, 2008). Thus, it was
observed that there might be a positive correlation between these two
genes.
Transfection of lentiviral based miR-15 and miR-16 clones separately
in MDA-MB-231 cells followed by RT-PCR assay has revealed the
reduction in gene expression of mTOR up to 2-folds and S6K1 up to
3-folds. (Fig. 3D, Additional Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained in
MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with p53 overexpression plasmid
(Fig. 3E). Further, to examine the target binding ability of these
microRNAs, reporter constructs were generated by cloning the 3′-UTR
of RPS6KB1 in psi CHECK2 vector downstream of synthetic Renilla

Fig. 5. miR-15/16 cause reduction in Twist1 and EZH2 that helps in EMT progression.
MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with microRNAs to observe their effects on Twist1
and EZH2 mRNAs that are crucial regulators of cell invasion and metastasis. Here transfection
with miR-15/16 (2 μg) resulted in reduction in mRNA levels of Twist1 and EZH2 in
MDA-MB-231 (invasive breast cancer) cells. GAPDH was used as a loading control.

luciferase gene. The full length construct of S6K1 3′UTR having binding
sites for microRNA-15 and miR-16 as well as Partial construct (P1) that
lacks the binding sites for microRNA-15, 16 were used to prove the
specificity. We observed reduction in luciferase gene expression in cotransfection
of miR-15 and miR-16 and S6K1 full length 3′-UTR in
MDA-MB-231 cells. Surprisingly, this reduction was not observed with
partial clone (P1) lacking miR-15, 16 binding site (Fig. 3F, Additional
Fig. 3). MicroRNAs of the miR-15/16 family are deleted in many cases
of CLLs (Calin et al., 2002; Bonci et al., 2008) and advanced prostate cancer.
Studies have shown that microRNAs that belong to this family regulate
cell cycle progression (Linsley et al., 2007). Since MDA-MB-231
cells contain mutant form of p53, we were interested to understand
the cell cycle regulatory role of exogenously transfected microRNAs on
cell cycle. Thus, we have transfected miR-15, miR-16 overexpression
plasmids in MDA-MB-231 cells. Studies revealed the existence of cell
cycle arrest at G1 phase with concomitant increase in the number of apoptotic
cells (Fig. 4B).
In general, G1 cell cycle arrest due to DNA damage exists in 2 phases —
initiation and elongation. Initiation phase is rapid and occurs due to degradation
of cyclin D1, a p53-independent response. However elongation
involves p53 dependent transcriptional regulation of p21, i.e. CDK1 inhibitor
(Santra et al., 2009). Thus, the main regulators of G1/S phase of cell
cycle were measured in miR-15 and miR-16 transfected MDA-MB-231
cells. Here, we have observed a tremendous decrease in the levels of cell
cycle regulatory proteins such as cyclin D1, cyclin E, Cdk2, Cdk4; and increase
in the levels of tumor suppressor proteins such as (p53, p21) as
well as apoptotic proteins (caspase-3, caspase-9 and PARP) (Fig. 4C, D).
This data strongly supports cell cycle arrest as well as tumor suppressive
nature of miR-15 and miR-16.
Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process by which
cancer cells change their epithelial phenotype to mesenchymal phenotype
and acquire metastatic ability, which is closely associated with the
invasion and metastasis (Gomes et al., 2011). Twist1 is basic helix–
loop–helix (bHLH) protein, an important transcription factor that is involved
in metastasis and worst outcome of breast cancer (Yang et al.,
2006). In addition, Polycomb (PcG) group of proteins act as chromatin
modifiers and regulate cancer phenotype. Among all PcG family of proteins,
EZH2 [Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2] that belongs to PRC2 complex,
bind effectively to target promoters and methylates histone
H3 at Lys27 there by resulting in transcriptional silencing (Czermin
et al., 2002). Thus, we have examined possible role of these microRNAs
(miR-15 and 16) in regulating the Twist1, EZH2 mRNA levels. Enforced
expression of microRNAs resulted in decreased mRNA levels of the
genes in MDA-MB-231 cells as well as neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 5 &
Additional Fig. 4). This indicates that miR-15 and miR-16 regulate
tumor suppression partly by affecting the EMT signaling.
Compelling evidence has indicated the ability of single miRNA to target
multiple target mRNAs. Moreover, understanding the role of miRs in
tumor cells provides valuable information about the miRNA involvement
in the regulation of molecular networks that result in cancerous
phenotype. MicroRNAs such as miR-199a-3p, miR-99a, miR-100, miR101,
miR-7 target the 3′-UTR of mTOR (Nagaraja et al., 2010; Fornari
et al., 2010). Reports indicate that microRNA i.e. miR-145 was found
to target 3′-UTR of S6K1 and inhibit angiogenesis (Xu-Monette et al.,
2012). Based on all the findings on p53 and mTOR/S6K1, we have
attempted to understand the effects of enforced expression of tumor
suppressor microRNAs miR-15 and miR-16 on S6K1 as well as mTOR.

5. Conclusions

In silico studies shown that these miRs such as miR-15 and miR-16 can
bind to 3′-UTR of S6K1. The current study envisaged the importance
of miR-15/16 in regulating RPS6KB1 in MDA-MB-231 cells that lack
functional p53. Loss- and gain-of-function of p53 confirmed the importance
of p53 in regulating the expression of miR-15/16. Enforced expression
of miR-15/16 has resulted in G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in

MDA-MB-231 cell line. This result is supported by significant decrease
in the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, Cdk2, Cdk4 as well as pronounced
increase in the expression of tumor suppressors (p53, p21) and proteins
involved in apoptosis (caspase-3, 9 and PARP). It was reported that the
presence of mutant p53 in cell lines leads to drug resistance and promote
cell migration and invasion (Kogan-Sakin et al., 2011; Wei et al., 2014). In
addition to the tumor suppressor properties, these miRs were found to
play a prominent role in the invasion and metastasis by regulating
Twist1 and EZH2. Since, over 50% of human cancers have mutant p53,
the functional restoration of miR-15/16 family that functions downstream
of p53 pathway can be provided as a novel therapy for such cancers.
