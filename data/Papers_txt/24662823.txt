Abstract
Met is a receptor tyrosine kinase that promotes cancer progression. In addition,
Met has been implicated in resistance of tumors to various targeted therapies such as EGFR
inhibitors in lung cancers, and has been prioritized as a key molecular target for cancer
therapy. However, the underlying mechanism of resistance to Met targeting drugs is poorly
understood. Here, we describe screening of 1310 genes to search for key regulators related
to drug resistance to an anti-Met therapeutic antibody (SAIT301) by employing a
siRNA-based synthetic lethal screening method. We found that knockdown of 69 genes in
Met-amplified MKN45 cells sensitized the anti-tumor activity of SAIT301. Pathway analysis
of these 69 genes implicated FGFR as a key regulator for anti-proliferative effects of Met
targeting drugs. Inhibition of FGFR3 increased target cell apoptosis through the
suppression of Bcl-xL expression, followed by reduced cancer cell growth in the presence
of Met targeting drugs. Treatment of cells with the FGFR inhibitors substantially restored
the efficacy of SAIT301 in SAIT301-resistant cells and enhanced the efficacy in
SAIT301-sensitive cells. In addition to FGFR3, integrin β3 is another potential
target for combination treatment with SAIT301. Suppression of integrin β3
decreased AKT phosphorylation in SAIT301-resistant cells and restores SAIT301
responsiveness in HCC1954 cells, which are resistant to SAIT301. Gene expression analysis
using CCLE database shows cancer cells with high levels of FGFR and integrin β3
are resistant to crizotinib treatment, suggesting FGFR and integrin β3 could be
used as predictive markers for Met targeted therapy and provide a potential therapeutic
option to overcome acquired and innate resistance for the Met targeting drugs.

Met, a typical receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) present on cell surfaces, is
overexpressed in various tumors and may contribute to the poor prognosis of several
malignancies
1
,
2
. Met functions to mediate a wide spectrum of signals driven by binding
with its ligand hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) and promotes cancer
progression, metastasis, cancer cell migration and angiogenesis
3
. HGF/SF binding to Met induces Met dimerization followed by the
activation of intracellular signal transduction such as MAPK and AKT
phosphorylation
4
,
5
. Among signal cascades induced by Met activation, AKT
phosphorylation is related to cell survival
6
; treatment of cancer cells with an anti-Met antibody results in marked
antiproliferative effect and a concomitant decrease of AKT phosphorylation and increase of
apoptosis
7
.
Because of the relevance of Met to cancer biology, it has been a popular target for
cancer drug development
8
,
9
. Several Met-targeted drugs such as cabozantinib, onartuzumab and tivantinib are in phase 3 registration trials. Every Met targeted drug being tested in phase 3
clinical trials targets Met and other targets simultaneously or in combination with another
drug
10
. Cabozantinib was approved by
the United States FDA to treat medullary thyroid cancer; this drug targets Met and vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) simultaneously
11
. Onartuzumab, an anti-Met monoclonal human antibody, and
tivantinib, a small molecule Met inhibitor, are in phase 3 clinical trials in patients with
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with erlotinib
12
–
14
.
Met has been validated as an oncogenic kinase in preclinical models through the use
of selective kinase inhibitors
15
–
17
. Although these inhibitors may induce early
responses, the emergence of drug resistance is common and limits their
effectiveness
18
. The Met pathway was
associated with acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in
EGFR
mutant NSCLCs
19
.
In turn, the activation of the HER family was shown to be responsible for the resistance of
PHA665752, a Met specific inhibitor, in Met-addicted gastric cancer cells
20
,
21
. It
was also reported that resistance to Met targeting inhibitors can occur through
MET
point mutations, especially at Y1230
22
,
MET
gene amplification followed by
KRAS
over-expression in Met-addicted gastric and lung cancer
cells
23
, and over-expression of
constitutively active SND1-BRAF fusion protein
24
. In NSCLC, the mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR/Met tyrosine
kinase inhibitor was attributed to the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
and the Wnt signaling pathway
25
.
However, the underlying mechanism of acquired or inherent resistance to Met
targeted antibodies has not been fully elucidated
26
–
28
. Although the
relationship between Met and other RTKs in the survival of Met drug resistant cancer cells
remains uncertain, it has been shown that Met inhibitor-driven resistance could be rescued
by inactivation of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) by small molecules
29
,
30
.
Recently, many approaches have focused on discovering biomarkers for patient selection and
exploring novel combination therapies
31
.
To systematically identify targets whose inhibition would increase the response of cancer
cells to Met inhibitors, we performed medium-throughput siRNA library synthetic lethal
screening targeting genes associated with systems biology-derived EGFR and Met signaling
pathways
32
. Here, we show that FGFR
could have a role as an alternative driver kinase for Met because dependence on either FGFR
or Met can be compensated by activation of the other kinase. Therefore, simultaneous
inhibition of FGFR and Met or intervention at a common downstream effector such as AKT is
required for effective Met targeted anti-cancer therapeutics.
Previous studies have shown that integrin β1 mediates EGFR drug resistance
and its association with the Met signaling pathway in NSCLCs
33
. Integrin β subunits are adhesion molecules involved
in cell survival and cancer resistance to chemotherapy in breast cancers
34
,
35
.
Here, we identify significant crosstalk between integrin β3 and Met in HCC1954
breast cancer cells and investigate the mechanism of Met drug resistance related to integrin
signaling. We also demonstrate that perturbation of integrin β3 and FGFR signaling
significantly inhibits proliferation of SAIT301-resistant MKN45 cells. These data provide a
strong rationale for the use of integrin β3 and FGFR inhibitors in Met-amplified
tumors that have become resistant to selective Met inhibition, or to combined therapy to
prevent these resistance mechanisms. Our findings demonstrate a specific crosstalk of
integrin, FGFR and Met pathways and suggest the partial overlap of downstream signaling and
common cellular effects of each pathway.Results
Synthetic lethal screening to identify sensitizers of cellular response to a Met
inhibitor
In order to identify molecular determinants that modulate cellular responses to
Met-targeted therapies we developed a siRNA library and performed synthetic lethal
screening using a Met-specific monoclonal antibody, SAIT301
7
,
36
. Previously we
reported that SAIT301 promotes Met degradation via a LRIG1-mediated pathway. SAIT301
treatment promoted the binding of Met with LRIG1, bypassing the Cbl-mediated Met
degradation pathway which requires Met activation. This unique mechanism permits SAIT301
to induce Met degradation without triggering Met signaling activation, and consequently
activate cellular apoptosis
7
. The siRNA
library used in our studies comprised of siRNAs targeting 1310 genes. We used Met as a
seed node to collect data from public archives reporting curated pathway information,
protein-protein interactions (PPIs), association in protein complexes, and putative genes
responsive to Met antibodies (
Supplementary Figure S1
). The data mining provided 828 genes in the Met-centered
network. As there is good evidence of crosstalk amongst the Met and EGFR pathways, we
included the 638 genes from an EGFR-centered network described by one of us
(LMW)
32
. A total of 1310 genes
comprised the final network, which included 156 genes shared by the two networks (
Supplementary Figure S1
).
The MKN45 gastric cancer cell line is dependent on Met signaling for
proliferation and survival. This cell line was screened with the siRNA library targeting
1310 genes in combination with vehicle or SAIT301 at IC
20
. Primary hits were
identified as genes that, when knocked down, cause reduction of cell viability by
>15% of normalized cell viability in the presence of SAIT301 compare with
vehicle control (False Discovery Rate (FDR) < 20% and Sensitization Index
(SI) < 0.85) in three independent experiments.
To further validate the positive hits, MKN45 cells were screened using the
deconvoluted siRNAs that target candidate genes identified in the initial screening
studies. Statistical analysis confirmed that 69 validated genes significantly increased
the sensitivity of MKN45 cells to SAIT301 treatment (
Table
1
). Therefore, the 69 genes were considered to be potential mediators of
resistance to SAIT301.
Figure 1a
demonstrates that
the distribution of viability and SI of 69 hits was independent of the viability reduction
induced by siRNA knockdown in the absence of antibody treatment. Most of the sensitizing
hits were connected in a physically interacting network (
Figure 1b
), and the distribution of these hits was random in the context of the
full library.

We next assessed the efficacy of these 69 putative sensitizers to SAIT301
treatment in seven other cell lines – NCI-N87 (gastric cancer), HCC827 (lung
cancer), BxPC3 (pancreatic cancer), H1993 (lung cancer), A549 (lung cancer), RKO (colon
cancer) as well as HCC1954 (breast cancer). As shown in
Figure 1c
, 24 genes sensitized at least three of these cell lines to the effects
of a Met targeting antibody.
Pathway analysis of the targets from the screen implicates the FGFR and integrin
pathways as key regulators of the efficacy of a Met targeting antibody
To delineate the functional associations and identify potential interacting
partners of the 69 validated hits, we evaluated the hit network using Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis (IPA) software (
http://www.ingenuity.com/
). Gene set
enrichment analysis showed that seven canonical signaling pathways were utilized by the
identified 69 hits (P<0.015). The genes involved in each individual pathway are
summarized in
Figure 2a
. As these pathways were all
statistically significantly enriched by the analysis, we examined the frequency of the
genes shared by different pathways. Genes such as
RAF1
,
AKT2
,
SOS1
,
KRAS
(shaded in blue) are
heavily shared by 6 out of 7 pathways, indicating that the RAS/RAF/MEK and PI3K/AKT
signaling pathways are common downstream pathways.
ITGB3
,
FGFR3
,
SGK1
(red, orange shades) are not shared by
more than two signaling pathways, therefore representing the involvement of individual
signaling pathways. Subsequent network analysis corroborated several interacting partners
of Met signaling that potentially mediate resistance to Met inhibitors. Among them, highly
ranked partners are cell surface receptors triggering intracellular signaling system, such
as
FGFR3
, involved in the FGFR signaling pathway, and
ITGB3
, triggering the integrin signaling pathway. Depletion of these two
genes significantly reduces cancer cell viability when employed in combination with
SAIT301 treatment. IPA analysis of the distribution of connections indicates potential
interactions amongst the FGFR, integrin and Met signaling pathways (
Figure 2b
), which may serve as compensatory pathways for escape from Met
blockade.

In silico
analysis was performed using the
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software and categorized the hits according to their
proposed enrichment for canonical pathways. The top seven signaling pathways are plotted
based on the number of genes identified within each pathway. (P<0.015). Hits were
included in one signaling pathway (red shades); two signaling pathways (orange shades);
three signaling pathways (yellow shades); four signaling pathways (green shades); and six
signaling pathways (blue shades). (

interaction partners were accessed using IPA. Nodes represent genes, with their shape
representing the functional class of the gene product, and the edges indicate the
biological relationship between the nodes. Hits are represented in pink outlined symbols,
interaction partners not in the hit list in black.
Based on these findings,
FGFR3
and
ITGB3
were
selected for further studies that explore the potential for SAIT301-based combination
therapy.
FGFR3 suppression increases the anti-proliferative effects of SAIT301 by induction of
apoptosis in MKN45 cells
FGFR signaling is known to be responsible for acquired resistance to RTK
inhibitors, such as crizotinib in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
29
and vemurafenib in melanoma
37
. In the synthetic lethal screening studies described here,
the growth inhibitory effect of SAIT301 was increased with concomitant knockdown of the
FGFR3
gene in MKN45 cells compare with control siRNA transfected MKN45
cells (
Figure 3a
). Knockdown of
FGFR3
gene also increased the growth inhibitory effect of other Met
inhibitors such as PHA665752 and XL-184 (
Figure 3b and
3c
); PHA665752 is a small molecule inhibitor that specifically targets
Met
17
, and XL-184 is a small
molecule inhibitor that targets the Met, VEGFR2, and Ret kinases
38
. We then investigated the mechanisms through which
FGFR3
knockdown promotes the anti-tumor activity of SAIT301 in MKN45
cells.
FGFR3
knockdown increased the apoptosis of MKN45 cells compare
with treatment with SAIT301 alone (
Figure 3d
).
Apoptosis induction by
FGFR3
suppression was further confirmed by
cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 (
Supplementary Figure S2
). It is reported that FGFR3 inhibition leads to
apoptosis due to decreased expression of Bcl-2
39
. We therefore examined the expression of Bcl-xL, which is transcribed
by
BCL2L1
, one of the 69 sensitizers identified by our synthetic lethal
screening.
FGFR3
knockdown substantially enhanced reduction of Bcl-xL
protein and SAIT301-induced PARP cleavage (
Figure
3e
). To determine the underlying signaling mechanism for the regulation of Bcl-xL
expression, we tested the MAPK inhibitors (SB203580 and U0126) and an AKT inhibitor
(MK-2206). Interestingly, a p38 inhibitor, SB203580, in the presence of a Met targeting
antibody, suppressed Bcl-xL expression, followed by induction of apoptosis (
Figure 3f
). Consistent with this finding,
BCL2L1
knockdown also increased the growth inhibitory effect of SAIT301
(
Figure 3g
). Additionally, FGFR signaling
activation by bFGF treatment restored the growth inhibition induced by SAIT301 (
Supplementary Figure S3
), further
confirming the role of FGFR activity in cellular sensitivity to a Met-targeting antibody.
These data strongly support that FGFR signaling has an anti-apoptotic role in MKN45 cells
by sustaining Bcl-xL expression, and FGFR suppression makes these cells susceptible to
apoptosis induced by Met-targeting drugs.

hours. (

Combinations of selective FGFR inhibitors and Met inhibitors synergistically inhibit
cancer cell growth accompanied by induction of apoptosis
Because genetic knockdown of
FGFR3
sensitizes MKN45 cells to
SAIT301 treatment, we assessed whether pharmacological inhibitors of the FGFR family have
similar effects. The small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PD173074, is a specific and
potent inhibitor of the FGFR family
40
.
PD173074 potently inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR in MKN45 cells and siRNAs
directed against other FGFR family members also increased Met targeted antibody-mediated
efficacy (
Supplementary Figure
S4
). MKN45 cell viability was reduced by Met inhibition using SAIT301 alone, and
this inhibition was significantly enhanced by the addition of PD173074 (combination index
[CI] < 1; isobologram analysis;
Figure 4a
).
PD173074 treatment also promoted the cell growth inhibitory effect of crizotinib, a small
molecule targeting Met as well as ALK
16
,
PHA665752, and XL-184 (
Figure 4b, 4c and 4d
). To
further confirm this effect, we tested EBC1, a lung cancer cell line that is known to be
addicted to Met signaling for its survival
7
. Cell growth inhibitory effect of SAIT301 was increased by the addition
of PD173074 in EBC1 cells (combination index [CI] < 1; isobologram analysis;
Figure 4e
). Like MKN45 cells, EBC1 cells showed marked
reduction of cell viability when treated with Met targeting inhibitors, PHA665752 and
XL-184, in the presence of PD173074 compare with the treatment with either drug alone
(
Supplementary Figure S5a and
S5b
). We tested another selective FGFR inhibitor, NVP-BGJ398 (hereinafter
referred to as BGJ398) that is currently in phase I clinical trials
41
. BGJ398 combined with SAIT301 also has a
synergistic effect on growth inhibition of both EBC1 and MKN45 cells (combination index
[CI] < 1; isobologram analysis;
Supplementary Figure S6
). We then determined if the effects of combining FGFR
inhibitors with SAIT301 were due to induction of apoptosis. SAIT301-mediated cell
apoptosis in EBC1 cells was dramatically enhanced with the addition of PD173074 or BGJ398
(
Figure 4f
). Furthermore, as measured by immunoblot
analysis, PD173074 significantly induced PARP cleavage when combined with SAIT301 (
Figure 4g
). PD173074 alone had no effect on the protein
levels of Bcl-xL, but exposure to the combination of PD173074 and SAIT301 induced a nearly
complete ablation of Bcl-xL. As
BCL2L1
knockdown improved SAIT301
efficacy in MKN45 cells, combined treatment with SAIT301 and ABT-263, a potent inhibitor
of Bcl-xL
42
, synergistically inhibited
cell growth of EBC1 cells (
Figure 4h
). Crizotinib
also synergized with BGJ398 in EBC1 cells (
Figure 4i and
4j
). BGJ398 treatment increased the apoptotic rate induced by Met inhibitors,
PHA665752 or XL-184 (
Figure 4k and 4l
). These data
suggest that FGFR activation maintains anti-apoptotic regulation in Met-addicted cancer
cells. We further confirmed the combination effect using a nude mouse heterotropic MKN45
xenograft model. SAIT301 demonstrated an inhibition of tumor growth, resulting in the
reduction of tumor volume by 27.8%. Combination treatment of SAIT301 and BGJ398
resulted in the reduction of tumor volume by 41.2% (
Supplementary Figure S7
). These
findings further support the concept that FGFR inhibitors and Met-targeted drugs
cooperatively inhibit cancer cell growth.

MKN45-SAIT301 resistant cells display activation of FGFR3, which confers resistance
to Met inhibition through reactivation of AKT signaling
Since acquired resistance is a general phenomenon in targeted therapy,
identifying the relevant resistance mechanisms can improve the clinical benefit of
targeted cancer drugs
43
. We created
SAIT301-resistant clones of MKN45 cells and EBC1 cells that originally were sensitive to
this antibody
7
. The viability of
SAIT301-resistant clones nos. 1 and 24 was not affected by SAIT301 treatment
at up to 2 µg/ml concentrations that induced ~50% growth
inhibition in parental MKN45 cells (
Figure 5a
). To characterize underlying molecular mechanisms of resistance in
these SAIT301-resistant clones, we investigated the activation status of several signaling
mediators. As shown in
Figure 5b
, the phosphorylation
of FGFR3 and AKT is higher in SAIT301-resistant clones compare with the parental MKN45
cells. To test if insensitivity of resistant cells to SAIT301 is due to the activation of
AKT, we performed cell viability assays with SAIT301 in the presence of an AKT inhibitor,
MK-2206
44
,
45
. AKT inhibition using MK-2206 re-sensitized MKN45-SAIT301 resistant
cells to SAIT301 in a dose-dependent manner (
Figure
5c
and
Supplementary Figure
S8a
).

with the AKT inhibitor (MK-2206, 5 µM) for 72 hours. The relative cell viability
(%) represents percent growth compared to the control group (no antibody and
inhibitor treatment). (

) AKT phosphorylation was detected by immunoblot
assay in MKN45-SAIT301 resistant clone #24 cells. Twenty-four hours after
pre-treatment of FGFR inhibitor (PD173074, 10 µM), MKN45-resistant clone
#24 cells were treated with medium or 2 µg/ml of SAIT301 for 1 hour.
(

µM). The relative cell viability (%) represents percent growth compared to
the control group (no antibody and inhibitor treatment). (

) The viability of
EBC1-SAIT301 resistant clone #20 cells was measured by CTG assay after treating
with various concentrations (8, 12, 16 and 20 nM) of crizotinib alone or in combination
with the FGFR inhibitor (BGJ398, 3 µM) for 72 hours. The relative cell viability
(%) represents percent growth compared to the control group (no antibody and
inhibitor treatment).
Because AKT is commonly involved in the signaling of several RTKs, FGFR could be
an upstream RTK of activated AKT in SAIT301 resistant clones. As shown in
Figure 5d
, SAIT301-mediated inhibition of AKT
phosphorylation was significantly enhanced by co-treatment with PD173074. To investigate
the role of FGFR in acquired resistance for SAIT301, MKN45-SAIT301 resistant clone
#24 cells were treated with SAIT301 and BGJ398. Concomitant inhibition of Met and
FGFR signaling using SAIT301 and BGJ398 led to a dose-dependent inhibition of viability of
MKN45-SAIT301 resistant cells (
Figure 5e
). Because
parental MKN45 cells displayed decreased levels of Bcl-xL following FGFR inhibition (
Figure 3e
), we tested whether Met inhibition in
combination with ABT-263 could inhibit the viability of MKN45-SAIT301 resistant cells.
ABT-263 as well as BGJ398 significantly reduced the cell viability of MKN45-SAIT301
resistant #1 cells treated with SAIT301 (
Supplementary Figure S8b
). To confirm the role of FGFR function in
acquired resistance to Met targeting therapy, we tested EBC1-SAIT301 resistant clones, and
found that AKT phosphorylation was elevated in these cells (
Supplementary Figure S9a
). Combined
inhibition of Met and FGFR led to a reduction of cell viability in a dose-dependent manner
(
Figure 5f
and
Supplementary Figure S9b
). These data
further support FGFR and its downstream pathway mediated signaling as a potentially
important mechanism of acquired resistance to Met inhibition.
ITGB3 inhibition improves the anti-tumor efficacy of SAIT301 in cancer cells with
acquired and innate resistance to Met inhibition
ITGB3
is another highly ranked hit from our synthetic lethal
screening study, and
ITGB3
is known to influence the development and
progression of breast cancers
46
,
47
. To investigate the relationship of
ITGB3
expression to Met resistance, knockdown assays were conducted
with MKN45-SAIT301 resistant cells. As shown in
Figure
6a
,
ITGB3
suppression by siRNA enhanced the effects of SAIT301
on cell viability. A potent integrin β3 inhibitor, cilengitide
19
,
48
,
also enhanced the effects of SAIT301 in MKN45-SAIT301 resistant cells (
Figure 6b
). Combination treatment of cilengitide further
enhanced SAIT301-mediated inhibition of AKT phosphorylation compared to treatment with
SAIT301 alone (
Figure 6c
).

) CCLE mRNA expression data with crizotinib treated
504 cell lines. Group A consists of cell lines with “low” expression of
FGFR2, FGFR3
and

, and Group B has cell lines
with “high” expression for at least one of the three genes.
HCC1954 breast cancer cells have high Met protein expression, and were employed
to test the efficacy of Met targeting drugs
49
. HCC1954 cells did not respond to SAIT301 treatment and were shown to
have very low protein levels of FGFR3 but relatively high levels of integrin β3
(data not shown). It is noteworthy that a FGFR inhibitor, PD173074, yields no synergistic
inhibition of proliferation with SAIT301 in these cells (data not shown). The reason might
be low levels of FGFR3 phosphorylation compared to MKN45 cells in which FGFR inhibitors
have synergistic effects with SAIT301 (
Supplementary Figure S10
). To investigate the role of
ITGB3
in
innate resistance to SAIT301, the effect of knockdown of
ITGB3
was tested
in HCC1954 cells. The combination of SAIT301 treatment and
ITGB3
knockdown resulted in greater inhibition of cell growth (
Figure 6d
) and AKT phosphorylation (
Figure
6e
) as compared to SAIT301 treatment alone.
Additionally, to elucidate the potential implication of
FGFR
and
ITGB3
in cancer cell responses to Met targeting therapy in general,
we first analyzed IC
50
values for 504 cell lines following treatment with
crizotinib (PF-2341066) from the CCLE database (
http://www.broadinstitute.org/ccle/
) and categorized each cell line into
three tiers (low, medium and high) based on the expression levels of
FGFR2
,
FGFR3
, and
ITGB3
, with cutoffs
at 33 and 67 percentile values. Cell lines that have “low” expression for
all three genes were assigned to Group A, while Group B consisted of cell lines that have
“high” expression for at least one of the three genes. The median
IC
50
values for Group A and B are 6.81 and 8.00, respectively (p=0.045 by
Mann-Whitney U test) (
Figure 6f
). These data provide
molecular validation of
ITGB3
or
FGFR
family as being
synthetically lethal with a Met inhibitor under defined conditions.DISCUSSION
As it is well known that repeated treatment with targeted cancer drugs eventually
leads to drug resistance
18
, investigating
the mechanism of acquired resistance is important in the development of cancer drugs. siRNA
screening has been demonstrated as an effective method for identifying the potential
mechanisms of acquired or inherent resistance to certain drugs
50
,
51
. We developed a
siRNA library centered to Met and EGFR signaling and performed synthetic lethal screening to
search for key regulators related to drug resistance against an anti-Met therapeutic
antibody. The siRNA library used in our studies was comprised of siRNAs targeting the 1310
Met- and EGFR-centered genes. By focusing on the statistically significant viability changes
and by filtering off-target effects by requiring two or more siRNAs to replicate the
effects, we were able to identify 69 genes connected to several signaling pathways that
likely mediate SAIT301 resistance. By examining the frequency of the genes shared by these
seven putative signaling pathways, we found many heavily shared hits (
RAF1
,
AKT2
,
SOS1
,
KRAS
) located at the
mediator level of cross-talk involved in resistance, did not represent any specific pathway.
In contrast, canonical pathway enrichment and network analysis of the 69 gene validated hit
set revealed enrichment of the integrin and FGFR signaling pathways. ITGB3 and FGFR3
regulate the integrin and FGF signaling pathways, respectively, are well enriched surface
molecules and are easily accessible to targeted therapies. Furthermore, potential
interaction indicated compensatory pathways amongst the FGFR, integrin and Met signaling
pathways.
Recent reports have referred to signaling crosstalk between FGFR and Met. In AML,
FGFR1 is responsible for innate resistance to crizotinib by inducing HGF
transcription
29
. In turn, HGF
secretion compensates for cancer cell growth inhibition by BGJ398, a selective FGFR
inhibitor
52
. The results from the
present study support previous findings, as we show that suppression of FGFR can
significantly improve the anti-proliferative effects of Met targeting drugs in Met-addicted
cell lines such as MKN45 (gastric cancer) and EBC1 (lung cancer). In MKN45, FGFR signaling
has an anti-apoptotic function by retaining Bcl-xL expression through constitutively active
p38, and suppresses the transcription of pro-apoptotic genes such as
TRAIL
and
BIM
(data not shown). Pharmacological inhibitors targeting FGFR
synergize with Met targeting drugs in preventing cancer cell growth
in
vitro
and
in vivo
. These data suggest that a Met targeting drug
in combination with an FGFR inhibitor warrants further interrogation in combination
therapy.
In the present study, we demonstrated that SAIT301-resistant clones obtained
through prolonged treatment with SAIT301 exhibit enhanced FGFR3 activation and increased AKT
phosphorylation. AKT activation appears to be a key mechanism for resistance to the
Met-targeting antibody, and MK-2206, an AKT inhibitor, restores the sensitivity of resistant
cells to SAIT301 (
Figure 5c
and
Supplementary Figure S8a
). FGFR
signaling compensates for the inhibition of Met in 2 ways, by retaining anti-apoptotic
molecules and by activating PI3K/AKT signaling. These data provide the rationale for further
investigation combinations of Met and FGFR inhibitors to overcome acquired resistance.
We also examined integrin signaling, which emerged as another highly ranked
resistance-promoting signaling pathway in the analysis of our screening studies. Met binds
to integrin β3 and promotes the migration and invasion of mammary epithelial
cells
47
. Suppression of
ITGB3
improved the efficacy of SAIT301
in vitro
, through
anti-proliferative effects but not by facilitating apoptosis in MKN45 cells (data not
shown). Cilengitide, an integrin β3 inhibitor, also restored sensitivity to SAIT301
in SAIT301-resistant MKN45 cells. In addition, integrin signaling may be related to innate
resistance to SAIT301. SAIT301 alone has no anti-proliferative effect on HCC1954, even
though this cell line possesses a relatively high level of Met expression compare with other
breast cancer cell lines. However,
ITGB3
inhibition combined with SAIT301
had significant anti-tumor effects. Interestingly, transcript levels of
ITGB3
are high in HCC1954 compare with other Met-addicted cell lines,
such as MKN45 and EBC1 (data not shown). These findings imply that
ITGB3
can be used as a putative predictive marker as well as a target for combination therapy
employing SAIT301. Although future studies will be required to confirm the hypothesis that
the expression of
FGFR
and
ITGB3
can both predict the
efficacy of SAIT301 and comprise a new combination treatment strategy, our synthetic lethal
screening approach appears to be a useful way to identify potential candidates for
combination with a tumor targeting monoclonal antibody that perturbs cancer cell
signaling.
In summary, we have identified a number of key regulators of resistance to a Met
targeting antibody by synthetic lethal screening. Among them, we have validated that FGFR
and integrin are important components for resistance mechanism toward SAIT301, and possibly
for Met inhibitors in general. Combining Met inhibitors with FGFR or integrin inhibitors may
be useful to mitigate the development of clinical resistance. In addition, both FGFR and
integrin may be useful as predictive markers for clinical response to Met inhibitors.Materials and methods
siRNA library construction
We have previously reported on an EGFR network targeted library
32
using EGFR as the seed protein. This network
was involved in this study based on the evidence of crosstalk amongst the Met and EGFR
pathways. A distinct Met-centered network containing 828 genes was developed using the
open source software tool, Cytoscape with Met as the seed protein. Bioinformatic databases
were mined for protein-protein interactions (PPIs), protein complexes, members of
canonical pathways linked with Met and additional genes include genes encoding RTKs
receptor tyrosine kinases and differentially expressed genes in SAIT301-treated NCI-H441
cells. These sources included BIND, BioGRID, DIP, HPRD, IntAct, MiMI, MINT, STRING,
Biocarta, Linnea, Protein Lounge, STKE, and literature searches (
Figure S1
). This resulted in a siRNA
library comprised siRNAs targeting 1310 genes.
Further testing of identified sensitizing genes in responsive and non-responsive cell
lines
We further tested the 69 validated hits for sensitization to SAIT301 in three
SAIT301 responsive cell lines (BxPC-3, HCC827, H1993) versus four SAIT301 non-responsive
cell lines (A549, NCI-N87, RKO and HCC1954). Cells were transfected with siRNA pools
comprised of two most effective siRNAs identified during the validation. SI and
statistical significance were calculated as in
Supplementary Information
. All experiments were performed at least
three times independently.
Network analysis with 69 validated hits
For canonical pathway enrichment, network analysis and gene interaction networks
were generated using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA; Ingenuity systems, Redwood City, CA,
USA;
www.Ingenuity.com
). 69 validated hits were uploaded into the application.
MiMI plugin for Cytoscape was used to access the integrated molecular data and to retrieve
interaction map that display protein interactions. All 69 genes were hierarchically
clustered as distance measure with Cluster 3.0, and then visualized using Java TreeView
(version1.1.6r2).
Generation of SAIT301-resistant MKN45 and EBC1 cells
in
vitro
To generate SAIT301 resistant clones, MKN45 and EBC1 cells were exposed to
increasing concentrations (range 1–10 µg/ml) of SAIT301 over 3 months
in vitro
. To confirm that these clones are durably resistant to
SAIT301, cell viability tests were performed after the resistant clones had been cultured
in the presence or absence of SAIT301 for 6 weeks.
Cell viability and apoptosis assay
Cell viability test and apoptosis assay were performed as previously
reported
7
,
36
. Synergism for drug combination was quantified by the combination
index (CI), where CI<1 and CI=0 indicate synergistic and additive effects,
respectively. CI was calculated with CalcuSyn software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK).Supplementary Material
