abstract

The cellular transcription factor E2F1 has been identified as a tumor suppressor regulating the activities of
p53 and its homologue TAp73, and promoting apoptosis by the activation of a plethora of death pathways.
More than 15 years of experimentation recognized E2F1 as the key player in apoptosis induced by DNA
damage in all types of human cancer. This occurs by several mechanisms that affect RB-E2F1 interaction,
E2F1 stability and its binding to promoters of E2F1-regulated genes. Recent progress has been made in
revealing new proapoptotic genes regulated by E2F1 and it seems that many still remain to be discovered.
However, whereas in the past one focused mainly on identifying E2F1 target genes translating cellular
stress signals into cell death, today the DNA damage-induced regulatory network governing E2F1’s ability
to induce apoptosis is rapidly gaining attention as well. Notably, the lately uncovered role of pRB and
E2F3 in triggering E2F1-dependent apoptosis through chemotherapy gains our understanding of the
DNA damage response in normal and tumor cells. In this context a large body of evidence indicates that
nuclear cofactors targeting E2F1 seem to have a major impact on its tumor suppressor function. These new
findings are discussed in the context of preclinical studies applying E2F1 overexpression in combination
with genotoxic anticancer agents – called chemogene therapy, thereby providing new mechanistic links
between the E2F1-induced apoptotic programming and advanced cancer phenotype.

1. Introduction

The E2F transcription factors have initially been identified as
being critical in the control of cell cycle progression by regulating
the timely expression of genes required for DNA synthesis at the
G1/S phase boundary (DeGregori, 2002). E2Fs are a family of DNA
binding proteins whose activity is intimately controlled through
association with hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein RB
and the pocket proteins p107 and p130. During cell cycle progression,
D-type cyclin associated kinases initiate phosphorylation of
RB family proteins, which results in the release of E2F and transactivation
of E2F-regulated genes (Dyson, 1998). The E2F family
consists of eight members (E2F1–E2F8) that are subdivided into
two classes based on their transcriptional regulatory activities: the
activator E2Fs (E2F1–E2F3a) that are potent transcriptional activators
driving G0 cells to cycle, and the repressor E2Fs (E2F3b–E2F8)
with weak activation potential that appear to be involved primarily
in gene silencing of quiescent or differentiated cells.

The E2F proteins perform distinct, perhaps overlapping, functions
in the control of cell cycle progression and have unique roles
during development, tissue homeostasis and apoptosis (Stanelle
and Pützer, 2006). During the course of tumor development cells
sustain mutations that disrupt their normal growth control mechanisms.
Mutations of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene
or components regulating the RB pathway have been identified
in almost every human malignancy. This results in deregulated
and hyperactive E2F in transformed cells leading to uncontrolled
cell proliferation. However, E2Fs’ role in determining cell fate
is not restricted to their effects on cell cycle progression. Compelling
evidence indicates that particularly E2F1 can also efficiently
induce programmed cell death as part of an anti-tumorigenic safeguard
mechanism that is critical in protecting the organism from
malignant transformation and for suppression of tumor formation.
Overexpression of E2F1 leads to apoptosis both in vivo and in tissue
culture (Holmberg et al., 1998; Hsieh et al., 1997; Hunt et al.,
1997; Phillips et al., 1997; Pierce et al., 1999; Qin et al., 1994; Shan
and Lee, 1994). The apoptotic response to deregulated E2F was best
demonstrated by the observation that RB-deficient mouse embryos
show increased apoptosis, which is suppressed by the loss of E2F1
(Tsai et al., 1998). Furthermore, deletion of E2F1 in mice showed
defects in thymocyte apoptosis with a higher resistance to death

inducing stimuli, and increased tumor incidence (Field et al., 1996;
Yamasaki et al., 1996).
One of the first signals recognized to induce E2F1 apoptotic
activity was DNA damage (Blattner et al., 1999). The DNA damage
signalling pathway is a highly conserved response to genotoxic
stress (Zhou and Elledge, 2000). In mammalian cells, the pathway
functions to protect cells from agents that induce cellular death or
transformation, participating in DNA repair and checkpoint control
leading to survival or apoptosis. In response to DNA damage, mammalian
cells initiate a cascade of phosphorylation events mediated
by two phosphatidylinositol-3-related kinases, ATM (ataxia telangiectasia
mutated) and ATR (ATMRad3-related), which transduce
signals to downstream targets and the checkpoint kinases Chk1 and
Chk2 (Abraham et al., 2002; Banin et al., 1998; Canman and Lim,
1998; Shiloh, 2001). ATM is activated primarily by double-strand
breaks induced by ionizing radiation, whereas ATR also responds to
ultraviolet (UV) radiation or stalled replication forks (Osborn et al.,
2002). The current model of the DNA damage response describes
a linear progression beginning with sensors that convey the initial
damage signal to mediators and transducers, which in turn
transmit the signal to numerous effectors. It has been shown that
treatment of cells with DNA damaging agents can induce endogenous
E2F1, and aberrant expression of this transcription factor was
found to increase the sensitivity of certain neoplastic cell types to
apoptosis when treated combined with genotoxic agents (Meng
et al., 1999; Polager and Ginsberg, 2003; Rödicker et al., 2001). A
significant contribution to understanding of the physiological role
of E2F1 in control of apoptosis that follows genotoxic stress came
from Drosophila mutant flies (Moon et al., 2005), indicating that the
role of E2F1 within individual developing wing discs exposed to -irradiation
is extremely context dependent. Their and other data
suggested that E2F1 protects non-proliferating cells while it sensitizes
proliferating cells to -irradiation-induced
cell death (Chen
et al., 2009; Moon et al., 2005; Wikonkal et al., 2003). In normal
cells, in the absence of DNA damage and in the presence of proper
external signals for survival and growth, the apoptotic potential of
E2F1 is suppressed. Conversely, when normal cells experience DNA
damage or lack growth and survival signals, its apoptotic activity is
unleashed. The induction of E2F1 by DNA damage occurs through
several molecular mechanisms that affect the pRB–E2F1 interaction,
E2F1 stability and/or the binding of E2F1 to promoters of
specific E2F-regulated genes.

2. Activating E2Fs as responders to DNA damage-induced
genotoxic stress

The E2F1 protein level is, like the tumor suppressor p53, upregulated
in response to DNA damage (Blattner et al., 1999; Hofferer
et al., 1999; Huang et al., 1997). This occurs at least in part through
increased protein stability due to the phosphorylation of E2F1 at
Serine 31 and 364 by the DNA damage sensors ATM, ATM- and
Rad3-related protein (ATR), Chk1 and Chk2 (Lin et al., 2001; Stevens
et al., 2003; Urist et al., 2004). Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-
mediated knockdown of either Chk1 or Chk2, for example, was
shown to prevent the induction of E2F1 protein in response to DNA
damage (Urist et al., 2004). Because E2F1 also functions upstream
of these kinases by transcriptionally regulating their expression,
DNA damage triggers a positive-feedback loop between E2F1 and
ATM/Chk2 (Berkovich and Ginsberg, 2003; Powers et al., 2004;
Rogoff et al., 2002). Moreover, a recent study indicated that E2F1 is
phosphorylated on Serine 403 after doxorubicin treatment (Real
et al., 2010). E2F1 protein mutated at this site showed reduced
efficacy to transactivate target promoters during DNA damage
stress, but it remains to be determined which kinase is responsible
for Ser403 phosphorylation and whether this has influence
on E2F1s ability to induce apoptosis. Although phosphorylation

alone leads to increased stability of E2F1 protein, further protein
interactions are needed to compete with E2F1 protein degrading
processes. In this context, the phosphoserine-binding protein 14-
3-3 seems to have outstanding significance (Wang et al., 2004).
14-3-3 has high affinity to ATM-phosphorylated E2F1 during DNA
damage, hence blocking its ubiquitination. Knockdown experiments
demonstrated that 14-3-3 and E2F1, but not E2F2 or E2F3,
are critical for apoptosis induction by doxorubicin, and that 14-3-
3 is required for E2F1-mediated expression of proapoptotic targets
such as p73, Apaf-1, and caspases in response to genotoxic stress.
In addition, the apoptotic function of E2F1 upon DNA damage
can be potentiated by posttranslational acetylation, which leads
to enforced recruitment of the transcription factor to promoters
of proapoptotic genes (Pediconi et al., 2003). This is mediated via
binding of the stress inducible histone acetyl transferases P/CAF
(p300/CREB-binding protein associated factor) and p300 to E2F1
(Galbiati et al., 2005; Ianari et al., 2004), and has been shown to
affect E2F1 transcriptional activity towards target selection, resulting
in selective induction of p73 for a favorable apoptotic response
(Pediconi et al., 2003). But the increase in E2F1 protein levels is
not only a reflection of enhanced protein stability. As recently
reported, genotoxic drugs can induce the transcription of E2F1
mRNA as well (Carcagno et al., 2009). Therefore E2F1 target gene
induction by DNA damaging agents might be the result of two welldifferentiated
effects, which depend on protein stabilization and de
novo protein synthesis (Fig. 1).
Nevertheless, what seemed to be a transcriptional E2F1 feedback
loop, turned out to be more complex. The Chauchereau group
recently found that E2F3a is a substrate of the checkpoint kinases
Chk1 and Chk2 (Martinez et al., 2010). Both E2F3 isoforms are identical
except that the E2F3a protein has an additional 132 amino
acids in its N terminus, which contains a chk motif that permits
the protein to be phosphorylated by DNA damage. It is intriguing
that neither Serine 124 in human E2F3a nor Serine 364 in
human E2F1 are conserved in the mouse. One can only speculate
that these chk motifs in the human E2Fs have been evolutionary
adopted recently and constitute a mechanism for a rapid increase in
protein levels. Their data revealed that E2F1 and E2F2 are transcriptionally
induced upon DNA damage in an E2F3-dependent manner
(Martinez et al., 2010), suggesting an interdependency between
E2F1 to E2F3 in activating each other after genotoxic stress. On the
basis of these results, it appears that upregulation of all three E2F
transcription factors is part of the DNA damage response machinery.
However, although it was recently shown that all activating
E2Fs are able to transactivate promoter constructs of certain apoptotic
target genes (Cassimere et al., 2009), a previous study reported
that E2F3a could not induce apoptosis in cells deficient for E2F1,
whereas E2F1 did not require E2F3 for the induction of cell death
(Lazzerini Denchi and Helin, 2005). Such observations would support
a model in which total E2F1 activity is the determinant of
whether cells will undergo apoptosis (Lazzerini Denchi and Helin,
2005). This hypothesis is confirmed by other groups which associate
apoptosis function of E2F1 with specific cofactors induced by
DNA damage.

3. Role of RB in E2F1-mediated genotoxic stress responses –
a challenge to the RB–E2F paradigm

The induction of E2F1s apoptotic activity by DNA damage
affects its interaction with the pRB protein. This raises the question
whether pRB counteracts E2F1s response upon DNA damage
or both tumor suppressors cooperate to promote apoptosis. pRBs
tumor suppressive activity is thought to be largely dependent upon
its ability to directly bind members of the E2F family in a hypophosphorylated
state and prevent them from promoting transcription
of their target genes (Trimarchi and Lees, 2002). In general, this

Fig. 1. Upregulation of activator E2F transcription factors is part of the DNA damage response machinery. Cytotoxic drugs stimulate DNA damage sensor kinases ATM/ATR and
CHK1/2 which in turn phosphorylate E2F1 (Serine 31, 364) and E2F3a (Serine 124) causing rapid protein stabilization. 14-3-3 proteins protect E2F1 from dephosphorylation.
Promoter autoactivation of E2F1-3 leads to their de novo protein synthesis with the ultimate goal to maximize E2F1 protein levels. When E2F1 becomes acetylated by DNA
damage sensitive histone acetyl transferases PCAF or p300 (Lysine 125, 120, 117), it can efficiently transactivate a subset of proapoptotic target genes. Hence, E2F1 is the
unique executor of the death program in response to DNA damage inflicting drugs.
inhibition occurs through pRB binding with its pocket domain to
sequences within E2Fs transactivation domain, and the resulting
pRB–E2F complex recruits a number of transcriptional corepressors
such as histone deacetylases (HDACs). In the case of E2F1, an additional
C-terminal domain of pRB also binds the transcription factor
(Dick and Dyson, 2003). This secondary binding site within pRB
inhibits specifically E2F1-induced apoptosis and binding of E2F1 to
this site is lost after DNA damage (Dick and Dyson, 2003). In particular,
this domain becomes acetylated after DNA damage, resulting
in E2F1 release without affecting the binding of pRB to other E2Fs
(Markham et al., 2006). As a consequence of DNA damage-induced
pRB acetylation, E2F1 can accomplish its tumor suppressor function
by inducing the expression of apoptotic target genes (Fig. 2A, right).
Apart from that, DNA damage induces not only the dephosphorylation
of pRB at cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation
sites and binding of pRB to E2F1, but also pRB phosphorylation
at Ser612 by Chk1/2 in an ATM-dependent manner (Inoue et al.,
2007). Notably, this DNA damage specific phosphorylation is not
associated with disruption of the pRB/E2F1 (E2F2 or E2F3) complex,
suggesting that the widely assumed dogma that hyperphosphorylated
pRB is functionally inactive and dephosphorylation restores
pRB to the active state seems to lose validity after DNA damage.
Ser612-phosphorylation resulted in pRB-dependent inhibition
of E2F1-induced transcription of cell death genes such as p73,
thereby efficiently counteracting E2F1s response to genotoxic stimuli
(Fig. 2A, left) (Inoue et al., 2007).
In contrast, other studies provided the molecular basis for pRBs
direct role in enhancing E2F1 apoptosis after DNA damage. Genotoxic
stress induces pRB to participate in a transcriptionally active
complex with E2F1 and the histone acetylase P/CAF that drives
expression of proapoptotic genes like p73 and caspase 7 (Fig. 2B)

(Ianari et al., 2009). While pRB knockdown experiments reduced
transcription and dampened apoptosis upon chemotherapy in vitro
and in vivo. At the same time, RB was shown to inhibit transcription
of cell cycle related genes by formation of an RB–HDAC–E2F1
complex. These results are in accordance with an earlier study, suggesting
that E2F1 is directed from cell cycle progression to apoptotic
E2F target genes after DNA damage, and that PCAF activity is important
for the potentiation of E2F1-dependent apoptotic responses
(Pediconi et al., 2009).
Based on the above mentioned studies, pRB seems to have a
dual role in response to DNA damage, acting both as E2F1 repressor
and activator. Chk1/2 phosphorylation rather promotes E2F1-3
repression, whereas C-terminal pRB acetylation allows in theory
E2F1-dependent apoptosis. On the contrary, pRB can permit
apoptosis through direct binding of E2F1. Whether these posttranslational
modifications are required in physiological settings to
enhance E2F1s transcriptional activity upon stress signals remains
elusive. Yet, the current data clearly indicate that pRB plays a much
more nuanced perhaps cell context-dependent role in the regulation
of E2F1-induced apoptosis in damaged cells.

4. Cofactors regulating E2F1 DNA damage response
signalling
4.1. Jab1

As the first proapoptotic cofactor of E2F1, Jab1 was identified.
Jab1, originally found as a specificity factor for c-Jun and JunD transcription
factors, interacts specifically with E2F1 via the marked
box domain and mediates E2F1-induced apoptosis (Hallstrom and
Nevins, 2003). This conserved region of E2F1 was previously shown
to have unique proapoptotic activity that distinguishes E2F1 from
122 D. Engelmann, B.M. Pützer / Drug Resistance Updates 13 (2010) 119–131

Fig. 2. The influence of RB on the E2F1-3 DNA damage response. Two models
are under debate: (A) pRB acts as indirect regulator of E2F1-dependent apoptosis.
Upon DNA damage pRB becomes phosphorylated at Serine 612 between the
pocket domains A and B, leading to a stable pRB–E2F1–3 complex that inhibits
E2F-dependent gene expression (left). Acetylation of the C-terminal E2F1 binding
domain (orange shading) provokes the release of E2F1 (without affecting E2F2 or
E2F3) and free E2F1 transactivates apoptotic target genes (right). (B) pRB directly
stimulates E2F1-dependent apoptosis when cell are exposed to stress signals. The
Rb-E2F1 complex is part of the active transcription machinery on proapoptotic E2F
target genes and required for a maximal cell death response (right). Likewise, pRB
acts as repressor of E2F1 on promoters of cell cycle genes by recruiting HDACs (left).
other E2Fs (Hallstrom and Nevins, 2003). Further investigations of
how E2F1 specifically regulates antioncogenic apoptosis though
other activating E2Fs such as E2F3a are able to bind certain
proapoptotic E2F target gene promoters (Cassimere et al., 2009)
pointed to the involvement of E2F1 specific cofactors that enhance
the apoptotic gene expression pattern after DNA damage. Over the
past years there has been a substantial increase in our understanding
of the mechanistic control of E2F1 driven gene expression by
cofactors that, like Jab1, bind E2F1 and thereby have a significant
influence on its DNA damage response signalling.

4.2. BRIT1/MCPH1

One of these cofactors participating in E2F1-induced apoptosis
upon cellular stress is BRCT-repeat inhibitor of hTERT expression/microcephalin
(BRIT1/MCPH1), a breast cancer susceptibility
gene 1 (BRCA1) C-terminal domain (BRCT) containing protein.
There is clear evidence, that BRIT1/MCPH1 colocalizes with mediator
of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) and-H2AX
in response to
ionizing radiation, suggesting that it is required for the formation of
DNA damage response foci (Lin et al., 2005; Rai et al., 2006; Xu et al.,
2004). Strikingly, BRIT1/MCPH1 siRNA caused radio-resistant DNA
synthesis and repression of BRAC1 and CHK1 at the transcriptional
level via a mechanism that involves E2F1. Based on recent findings,
MCPH1 cooperates with E2F1 to regulate genes involved in DNA
repair, checkpoint and apoptosis such as RAD51, DDB2, TopBP1,
p73 and caspases upon chemotherapy through complex formation
on the promoters of these genes (Yang et al., 2008). This interaction
depends on the amino terminus of E2F1. Additionally, E2F2
which is also upregulated in response to DNA damage (Martinez et
al., 2010) is bound by MCPH1, even though E2F2s function in DNA
damage is as yet unclear.

4.3. RRP1B

In an attempt to identify genes specifically regulated by E2F1
that mediate E2F1-induced cell death, Paik et al. (2010) identified
the ribosomal RNA processing 1 homolog B (RRP1B) as target of
E2F1 that is not activated by other E2F family members. RRP1B is
important for apoptosis regulation by DNA damage and E2F1 overexpression.
Because this activity is mediated in part by physical
interaction between RRP1B and E2F1 on its own and other E2F1 target
gene promoters, RRP1B acts apparently as coactivator to prime
cells for E2F1-dependent killing after genotoxic stimuli. Whereas
the DNA binding domain of E2F1 seems to be critical for this interaction,
the mechanism by which RRP1B controls E2F1s transcriptional
activity is unknown. Since RRP1B does not contain any known DNA
binding or transactivation motif, the possibility exists that activation
occurs by displacing negative cofactors from the DNA binding
domain.

4.4. HCF-1

The host cell factor 1 (HCF-1) originally discovered as a cellular
coactivator of herpes simplex virus (HSV) transcription is
a heterodimeric complex of N- and C-terminal subunits. The Nterminal
subunit recognizes and binds to a short tetrapeptide
HCF-1 binding motif (HBM) with numerous transcription factors.
In particular, E2F1 associates through a short DHQY sequence with
HCF-1 next to the cyclin binding motif (CBM) within the cyclin
A/CDK2 binding domain.When bound to E2F1, HCF-1 displays coactivator
properties by selective recruitment of histone-modifying
activities, including the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) and Set-1
histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferases to E2F1-responsive promoters,
thereby triggering histone methylation and transcriptional
activation (Tyagi et al., 2007). Consistent with a function of HCF-1
in E2F1-mediated apoptosis in response to DNA damage induction,
E2F1, HCF-1 and MLL are recruited to proapoptotic E2F target
promoters upon doxorubicin treatment and activate transcription
(Tyagi and Herr, 2009). Inhibition of either HCF-1 or H3K4 methyltransferase
activity by depletion experiments has confirmed their
function for E2F1s ability to respond to DNA damage.

4.5. DP proteins

Further insight into the regulation of E2F1 activity during DNA
damage was gained by the La Thangue group (Milton et al., 2006),
suggesting that the interaction between 14-3-3 and the DP family
subunit DP-3 is of functional importance. DP proteins, DP-1 and DP2
(equivalent to murine DP-3) were shown to be essential for E2Fs
DNA binding activity by forming E2F/DP heterodimers that bind

Fig. 3. Nuclear cofactors are essential for E2F1s tumor suppressor function. Upon DNA damage, MCPH1 binds the N-terminal region of E2F1 and positively regulates its
transcriptional activity. The HCF1 binding motif HBM is in close proximity to the cyclin binding motif (CBM). HCF1 recruits H3K4 histone methyl transferases to activate gene
transcription. RRP1B is a direct E2F1 target gene induced after DNA damage that physically interacts with E2F1s DNA binding domain (DBD), leucine zipper domain (LZ),
and marked box domain (MB). This binding is required for E2F1s ability to induce apoptosis. E2F transcription factors dimerize with DP proteins to bind DNA. The E2F1/DP-3
complex is induced in response to stress signals by disruption of the binding of 14-3-3 to DP-3. NLS, nuclear localization signal; TA, transactivation domain; RB, pocket

to and regulate E2F target genes (Trimarchi and Lees, 2002). They
found that DP-3 physically interacts with 14-3-3 in intact cells
(Milton et al., 2006). Disruption of the 14-3-3/DP-3 complex either
by DNA damage or siRNA-mediated 14-3-3 knockdown caused
elevated apoptosis, which correlated with increased levels of DNA
damage-responsive DP-3. These results implicated DP-3 as part of
the activated E2F1 transcription complex during DNA damage that
specifically triggers apoptosis. The set of nuclear coregulators supporting
the E2F1-induced antioncogenic DNA damage response is
summarized in Fig. 3.

4.6. Additional interactions

Apart from drug-induced factors directly interacting with E2F1
to cooperate in cell death, another mechanism of genotoxic
agents to trigger E2F1-induced apoptosis is the disruption of E2Frepressive
complexes from proapoptotic target gene promoters. It
is well known that C-EBP is part of the E2F4–p107 complex antagonizing
E2F1s transcriptional activity (Chen et al., 1996; Timchenko
et al., 1999). It was suggested that treatment of cells with DNA
damaging agents induces nuclear export of C-EBP and blocking
of this export abolished drug-induced p73 activation (Marabese
et al., 2003). Moreover, oncogenes like adenoviral E1A protein
lead to an activation of E2F1s proapoptotic machinery (Ianari et
al., 2009). A recent study showed that upregulation of E2F1 and
sensitization to chemotherapy-induced death requires the region
of E1A which binds p400 (Helgason et al., 2010). The authors
substantiated a direct protein–protein interaction between E2F1
and p400. Knockdown of p400 enables E2F1 induction and sensitizes
cells expressing an E1A mutant lacking p400 binding to
chemotherapy (Helgason et al., 2010). Although the exact molecular
mechanism remains to be elucidated, E1A may sequester
p400 away from E2F1 enabling its function to prime for genotoxic
agents.

5. Multiple pathways leading to E2F1 driven apoptosis

In recent years, extensive studies have been made to answer
the question how E2F1 initiates apoptosis. Here, a large number of
proapoptotic target genes have been shown to be E2F1 regulated
and it is most likely that many still remain to be identified. Although
E2F1 is mainly believed to be an activator of gene expression,
it became apparent that this protein also immediately represses
transcription of genes directly involved in cell survival. In fact,
it was shown that E2F1-3 can function as activators and repressors
depending on the cell context (Chong et al., 2009). E2F1s
signalling to apoptosis remains complex since promoter binding,
direct protein–protein interactions and modulation of posttranslational
RNA modification contribute to its ability to trigger a variety
of cell death pathways as discussed below.

5.1. E2F1 activates the p53 family

Commonly, mechanisms of apoptosis induced by the activation
of E2F1 either by overexpression or as response upon DNA
damage inflicting drugs are classified as being p53-dependent or
p53-independent. The first described mechanism by which E2F1
induces apoptosis is the activation of p53 due to protein stabilization.
While E2F1 does not bind to the p53 promoter, transactivation
of p14ARF leads to p53 accumulation, which in turn causes apoptosis
by activating p53 target genes (Bates et al., 1998; Hiebert
et al., 1995). Although E2F1 was the first family member being
discovered to initiate p53-dependent apoptosis, all activator E2Fs
are able to directly bind and stabilize p53 via their cyclin A binding
domain. Cyclin A normally prevents E2F1 from interacting and
cooperating with p53. However, in response to DNA damage, cyclin
A levels decrease, with a concomitant increase in E2F1–p53 complex
formation (Hsieh et al., 2002). In addition, E2F1 triggers p53
protein stabilization during DNA damage through transcriptional
124 D. Engelmann, B.M. Pützer / Drug Resistance Updates 13 (2010) 119–131

activation of ATM, CHK1 and CHK2 leading to phosphorylation
of p53 (Berkovich and Ginsberg, 2003; Yang et al., 2008). Of
note, the nutrient energy sensor AMP kinase  2 (AMPK2),
identified as an E2F1 target gene in p53-positive cells, has been
implicated in E2F1s apoptotic activity (Hallstrom et al., 2008).
Future research has to clarify whether this signalling requires
functional p53 because AMPK2 phosphorylates p53 (Jones et
al., 2005). Others reports have shown that E2F1 guided p53 activation
occurs via pathways in addition to protein stabilization
(Polager and Ginsberg, 2009). E2F1 can, for example, upregulate
the expression of p53 apoptotic cofactors, such as ASPP1, ASPP2,
JMY and TP53INP1, which have been shown to direct p53 apoptotic
response through whether enhancing p53 interaction with
proapoptotic targets or promoting p53 phosphorylation (Hershko
et al., 2005).
Almost at the same time when the role of E2F1 as a potent
activator of p53 was established several studies in tissue culture
and transgenic mice models demonstrated that E2F1 can induce
cell death also independent of p53 (Hsieh et al., 1997; Phillips et
al., 1997). To date, we know that this is due to the fact that E2F1
transactivates a large number of proapoptotic genes. Noteworthy
is the finding that E2F1 and p53 share an overlapping but not
identical subset of target genes like APAF1, SIVA, NOXA or PUMA
(Fortin et al., 2004; Furukawa et al., 2002; Hershko and Ginsberg,
2004). Most importantly E2F1 was shown to directly activate transcription
of the p53 homolog p73 (Irwin et al., 2000; Stiewe and
Pützer, 2000; Vilgelm et al., 2008), which in turn stimulates gene
expression patterns that again partly overlap with those of p53
and E2F1. This pattern of regulation constitutes a modified feedforward
loop (Polager and Ginsberg, 2009) that can be understood
as a network whereby p53, p73 and E2F1 cooperate to activate the
same set of genes to subsequently gain a maximum induction of
cell death. On the other hand, redundancy of p53, p73 and E2F1
in gene activation in addition to their ability to upregulate a particular
proapoptotic gene set represents a failsafe tumor defense
mechanism.

5.2. E2F1 is a strong inducer of the mitochondrial death pathway
via a plethora of mediators

Elucidation of death pathways triggered by E2F1 revealed a
large number of directly regulated proapoptotic genes (Fig. 4).
These findings underscore the role of E2F1 as a key mediator of
mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization by positively regulating
the expression of virtually all known BH3-only proteins
(BID, BIK, BIM, BNIP3, HRK, NOXA and PUMA) (Cao et al., 2004;
Hershko and Ginsberg, 2004; Real et al., 2006; Stanelle et al., 2002)
that trigger complex formation of proapoptotic BH1-3 proteins
with subsequent cytochrome c release (Zhang et al., 2007). Moreover,
apoptosis inducing BH1-3 proteins like BOK are upregulated
by E2F1 (Rodriguez et al., 2006). Furthermore, E2F1 downregulates
expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1
(Croxton et al., 2002). It can also affect the expression of Bcl2,
but the exact nature of this effect is under debate. Although
some studies showed that E2F1 inhibits Bcl-2 expression, others
demonstrated increased protein levels (Eischen et al., 2001;
Gomez-Manzano et al., 2001b). Since activation of death pathways
at multiple levels is a common feature of E2F1, it is not surprising
that E2F1 driven apoptosis is carried out via transcriptional induction
of several caspases, including caspase-3, -7, -8, -9 (Cao et al.,
2004; Nahle et al., 2002), and Apaf-1 (Cao et al., 2004; Xie et al.,
2006). E2F1 also blocks caspase inhibition by direct transactivation
of Smac/DIABLO (Xie et al., 2006).
In addition, there is growing evidence that many immediate
E2F1 target genes indirectly trigger mitochondrial apoptosis. These
include FOXO3 (Nowak et al., 2007) belonging to the forkhead

family of transcription factors, which has been shown to drive
apoptosis via transcriptional activation of BIM, NOXA and PUMA
(Dijkers et al., 2000; Obexer et al., 2007; You et al., 2006a). Similar
to E2F1, FOXO3 triggers cell death by binding to p53 (You et
al., 2006b). FOXO3 is upregulated by chemotherapy and mediates
E2F1-induced chemosensitization of cancer cells (Engelmann et al.,
2010; Obexer et al., 2009). Thus, the E2F1–FOXO3 axis represents a
novel feedforward loop through which FOXO3 fortifies apoptosis by
activating in part the same cell death pathways as E2F1. Although
E2F1 does not directly transactivate BAX, a number of novel E2F1-
regulated genes are able to enforce BAX expression next to p73.
The transcription factor E1AF was shown to mediate sensitivity of
cancer cells to etoposide-induced cell death in response to E2F1
upregulation (Wei et al., 2008). Mechanistically, E1AF physically
interacts with the BAX promoter, leading to caspase-dependent
cell killing in conjunction with chemotherapy (Liu et al., 2008; Wei
et al., 2008). Other inducers of the mitochondrial death pathway
whose expression is controlled by E2F1 are the non-classic serine
protease inhibitor maspin (SERPINB5) (Ben Shachar et al., 2010),
a known target of p53, and the Krüppel-like transcription factor
KLF10 (Engelmann et al., 2010). KLF10 has been shown to promote
mitochondrial apoptosis induced by oxidative stress (Ribeiro
et al., 1999), by homoharringtonine or by bortezomib involving
Bax upregulation and caspase-3 activation (Jin et al., 2007). Both
maspin and KLF10 tumor suppressors have been demonstrated
to act as effectors of E2F1-induced sensitization of tumor cells
to genotoxic agents (Engelmann et al., 2010; Ben Shachar et al.,
2010).
Some clarity has been shed on the requirement of the ASK1-
p38 MAPK pathway for E2F1-induced apoptosis. E2F1 modulates
the activity of the p38 MAPK pathway through upregulation of
p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Hershko et al., 2006). This involves
transcriptional induction of the ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating
kinase 1) gene (also known as MAP3K5), a member of the mitogenactivated
protein kinase family that phosphorylates p38 MKKs by
direct promoter binding (Kherrouche et al., 2006). The relevance
of the ASK1–p38 connection for E2F1-mediated apoptosis is also
evidenced by data demonstrating that E2F1 regulates the activity
of the p38 signalling inhibitor Wip1. Knockdown of Wip1 has
been shown to enhance E2F1-dependent apoptosis (Hershko et al.,
2006). Exogenous expression of wild-type ASK1 or constitutively
active ASK1 induces death of various cells mainly through mitochondria
dependent caspase activation (Hatai et al., 2000). Overall
it is evident that activation of the mitochondrial pathway is a key
node within the E2F1-induced cell death network, emphasizing
that redundancy seems to have outstanding importance during the
evolutionary development of E2F1 apoptosis.

5.3. Inhibition of survival signalling

Another general mechanism by which E2F1 sensitizes cells to
apoptosis is inhibition of anti-apoptotic signalling. Activation of
tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) in response to TNF results
in the stimulation of NF-B via TRAF2, which contributes to the
inhibition of cell death (Chen and Goeddel, 2002; McConkey and
Zhu, 2008). E2F1 can downregulate TRAF2 protein levels, thereby
inhibiting anti-apoptotic NF-B signalling (Phillips et al., 1999). The
direct E2F1 target SIVA (Fortin et al., 2004) seems to mediate this
downregulation, since it promotes TRAF2 polyubiquitination and
protein degradation (Gudi et al., 2009). Moreover, E2F1 inhibits
DNA binding activity of NF-B by interacting with its subunit
p65 (Tanaka et al., 2002). Another example for its interference
with cell survival signals is the inhibition of heat shock proteins.
Unfolded protein response-mediated survival or cell death
is regulated by the balance between endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
chaperones GRP78 and Gadd153. E2F1 downregulates expression

Fig. 4. Roadmap for E2F1 apoptotic signalling. E2F1 stimulates the p53 family related death program by directly and indirectly influencing p53 stability, or through transcriptional
activation of TP73. E2F1 induces a variety of effector proteins, which in turn trigger cytochrom c release and caspase activation. Proapoptotic expression patterns
of E2F1 and FOXO3 partly overlap. In addition, E2F1 disrupts cell survival signalling by suppressing NFB, ER stress chaperons, ERK signalling, and inhibition of p53, p73 or
E2F acetylation. Furthermore, E2F1 has also been linked to anoikis and stress induced protein degradation, and alters gene expression by triggering proapoptotic splicing.

of GRP78 (also known as BIP) (Racek et al., 2008) normally protecting
cells from death induced by disturbance of ER homeostasis
(Miyake et al., 2000) by physical interaction with the ER stress
response element of the GRP78 promoter to displace positive
regulatory proteins Sp1 and TFII-I. Moreover, expression of the
94 kD glucose-regulated protein (GRP94) ER chaperone shown to
be upregulated in human esophageal cancers was inhibited by
E2F1 (Li et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2005). From these data it is
evident that E2F1-mediated apoptosis involves ER-related death
pathways. The MAPK cascade, one of the most predominant pathways
for cell growth and proliferation is negatively regulated by
dual specificity phosphatases (DUSP). Yin and colleagues found that
E2F1 is able to inhibit MAPK signalling in response to chemotherapeutic
drugs triggering the formation of ROS. Oxidative stress
induces transcriptional upregulation of DUSP1, DUSP2 and DUSP4
in a strictly E2F1-dependent manner, which in turn dephosphorylate
ERK. Knockdown experiments revealed that E2F1-mediated
shut-down of ERK signalling is required for ROS-induced cell death
(Wang et al., 2007b,c; Wu et al., 2007). SIRT1 is a NAD+-dependent
class III deacetylase regulating cell survival by binding and antagonizing
transcriptional activities of p53, p73 and E2F1. E2F1 can
upregulate the expression of SIRT1 upon DNA damage constituting
a potential oncogenic negative feedback loop. The physiological
relevance of these interactions is highlighted by an increased apoptotic
activity of E2F1, p53 and p73 following SIRT1 inactivation (Dai
et al., 2007; Vaziri et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2006). But recent studies
showed that DNA damaging agents counteract SIRT1-related
tumor suppressor deacetylation in two respects: First, the hypermethylated
in cancer 1 (HIC1) gene, which is transcriptionally
activated by E2F1 upon chemotherapy (Jenal et al., 2009), encodes
a zinc finger transcriptional repressor that cooperates with p53
to suppress cancer development by antagonizing SIRT1 function
in DNA damage response (Chen et al., 2005). Secondly, apoptotic
DNA damage decreases NAD+ and inhibits SIRT1 activity, thereby
favoring the assembly of transcriptionally active PCAF/E2F1 complex
onto the P1p73 promoter and apoptosis irrespective of the p53
status (Pediconi et al., 2009). This is an example how chemotherapeutics
cooperate with E2F1 to induce cell death via two distinct
mechanisms.

5.4. Non-canonical E2F1-induced cell death pathways

The role of E2F1 as an essential activator of classical apoptosis
pathways is well-established. Recent evidence suggests that E2F1
modulates cell fate at least in part also via non-canonical cell
death pathways. It was found that BIN1, originally identified
as a c-MYC-interacting tumor suppressor, is directly regulated
by E2F1 particularly after DNA damage (Cassimere et al., 2009).
The established link between E2F1 and BIN1 might represent a
pathway through which DNA damage-induced death is activated
in cancer cells regardless of p53, p73 and caspases. But one is still
groping in the dark when identifying the mechanism underlying
apoptosis associated with the stimulation of BIN1. It is conceivable
that the E2F1–BIN1 axis mediates anoikis since BIN1 was
implicated in cell polarity signalling and tissue remodeling of
different organisms (Prendergast et al., 2009). Another study that
also links E2F1 to anoikis showed that death-associated protein
kinase 2 (DAPK2) whose downregulation is required for -catenin
induced anoikis resistance of malignant epithelial cells (Li et
al., 2009) is transcriptionally activated by E2F1 (Britschgi et al.,
2008). Moreover, E2F1 provokes protein degradation as response
to genotoxic stress via upregulation of RhoBTB2 (Freeman et al.,
2008), although the mechanism beyond this observation remains
elusive. Considering that a remarkable number of transcripts
encoding proteins involved in the apoptotic pathway are subject to
alternative splicing, it was unsurprising that E2F1 is also capable of
controlling pre-mRNA processing events to execute apoptosis. In
response to DNA damage, E2F1 switches genes including caspase-8
and -9, Bcl-X, and c-FLIP towards proapoptotic isoforms through
the upregulation of splicing factor SC35 (Merdzhanova et al., 2008).
Together with the ability to induces cap methylation essential
for efficient gene expression (Cole and Cowling, 2009), these
observations suggest that an important and hitherto unrecognized
feature of E2F1 is the regulation of post-transcriptional processes
to contribute to the induction of cell death.
An intriguing addition was made by latest reports, indicating
that small non-coding RNAs (microRNAs or miRNAs) that
negatively regulate eukaryotic gene expression at the posttranscriptional
level are activated by E2F1-3a, and can in turn,
126 D. Engelmann, B.M. Pützer / Drug Resistance Updates 13 (2010) 119–131

inhibit mRNA translation of all three activator E2Fs by pairing
with complementary nucleotide sequence in their 3
-untranslated
regions (Emmrich and Pützer, 2010). Some of the E2F1-regulated
miRNAs have been implicated in the induction of apoptosis by
antagonizing the expression of prosurvival genes and/or cooperate
with p53 in the integration of apoptotic signals. Interestingly, miR449a/b,
recently discovered as direct transcriptional targets of E2F1
(Lize et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2009), were shown to diminish the
SIRT1 deacetylase leading to p53 hyperacetylation and increased
apoptosis after DNA damage (Lize et al., 2010). In addition, the
use of miRNAs to indirectly target potential survival factors provides
another general mechanism that enables E2F1 to modulate
chemoresistance. Vice versa, E2F1-induced miRNAs of the miR-449
family inhibited E2F1 itself, thereby establishing a negative feedback
loop that may be important for allowing mutual regulation
of major DNA damage-responsive gene regulators. Given the rapid
pace in the discovery of miRNA-E2F interactions, this all points to
regulatory networks of high complexity that might ensure the tight
control of E2F activities in a context-dependent manner.

6. Is E2F1 itself an anticancer agent?

6.1. E2F1 chemogene therapy approaches to overcome resistance
to conventional anticancer treatment

A critical determinant of the efficacy of anticancer therapies is
the ability of cancer cells to undergo apoptosis in response to DNA
damaging agents (Qiao and Wong, 2009). The success of genotoxic
treatments is attributed, at least in part, to the fact that DNA damage
induces cell death more readily in cancer cells than in normal cells.
The molecular mechanism(s) underlying the enhanced sensitivity
of cancer cells to drug-induced apoptosis are not fully understood.
As E2F1, which is frequently upregulated in human cancer cells, is
inducible by apoptotic DNA damage, it appears here of particular
significance. Therefore, many preclinical studies have attempted
to apply E2F1 overexpression as anticancer therapy. The effect of
E2F1 overexpression alone and in combination with chemotherapeutic
drugs – called chemogene – on tumor cells has been evaluated
in almost every common type of human cancer, including glioma,
melanoma, esophageal cancer, breast- and ovarian carcinoma, head
and neck squamous cell cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic carcinoma,
fibrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, leukemia and non-small-cell
lung cancer (Banerjee et al., 1998; Ben Shachar et al., 2010; Dong
et al., 1999, 2002; Elliott et al., 2002a,b; Engelmann et al., 2010;
Fueyo et al., 1998; Gomez-Manzano et al., 2001a; Hunt et al., 1997;
Kuhn et al., 2002; Liu et al., 1999; Nguyen et al., 2005; Nip et al.,
1997; Parr et al., 1997; Pruschy et al., 1999; Rödicker et al., 2001;
Yang et al., 1999, 2001). These studies have shown that apoptosis
induction by the combination treatments resulted in increased
responsiveness of tumor cells to chemotherapy while relatively
sparing normal tissues. They also indicated that the mechanism
of primary action of the used cytotoxic agents did not affect
E2F1s ability to chemosensitize cancer cells. A variety of different
genotoxic anticancer agents, including topoisomerase inhibitors
(etoposide, doxorubicin, SN38, ICRF-193), alkylating agents (BCNU,
temozolomide), antimetabolites (gemcitabine, fluorouracil), crosslinker
(cisplatin), and antimitotic agents (roscovitine, vinblastine,
paclitaxel) cooperated with E2F1 overexpression. Hence, it was not
an unexpected finding that E2F1 also had activity as radiosensitizer
(Pruschy et al., 1999; Nguyen et al., 2005). In sum, these experiments
indicate a universal role of E2F1 in mediating and enhancing
apoptotic signalling upon treatment with cytotoxic stressors in
cancer cells.
Considering the potential impact of cofactors on E2F1’s apoptotic
response to genotoxic agents in a physiological context, recent
data showed that RRP1B is involved in suppression of metastasis

and a gene expression profile obtained following its overexpression
predicted survival in breast cancers (Crawford et al., 2007). Thus,
it is possible that increased patient survival seen in breast cancers
with high RRP1B expression may be due to increased responsiveness
to genotoxic therapy. Similar to RRP1B, a function of the E2F1
cofactor MCPH1 as a tumor suppressor has been suggested by association
of genomic instability and metastasis with decreased levels
ofMCPH1 in human cancer (Rai et al., 2006). Given the crucial role of
E2F1 in the chemotherapeutic response, decreased expression levels
of E2F1 cofactors like MCPH1 or RRP1B in cancers might dampen
the apoptotic response to chemotherapy owing to lesser induction
of crucial E2F1 target genes preventing cancer progression.
In addition, several studies have shown that pharmacological
modulation of endogenous E2F1 is an efficient strategy to
sensitize tumor cells to DNA damaging agents. Recently, smallmolecule
inhibitors of MDM2 that impair p53 function by binding
to the tumor suppressor protein, the nutlins, have been developed
to reactivate p53 signalling in malignant cells with functional
p53 by antagonizing the MDM2–p53 interaction (Vassilev et al.,
2004). Nutlin-3a also inhibits E2F1s interaction with MDM2 in
p53-mutant cancer cells, leading to increased E2F1-dependent
upregulation of p73 and NOXA and apoptosis following DNA damage
(Ambrosini et al., 2007; Kitagawa et al., 2008). This suggests that
small-molecule inhibitors of E2F1 antagonists like nutlin can activate
E2F1 for apoptosis, providing an extended chemotherapeutic
option in human cancers with mutated p53.
However, irrespective of a potential benefit of increasing E2F1
activity to modulate tumor cell survival and chemoresistance
regardless of the p53 status, newer reports teach us that this
might be a double-edged sword. On one side, an investigation with
183 breast cancer patients who had undergone surgical resection
revealed that the E2F1-positive group had less tumor recurrences,
lymph node metastases during follow-up, and distant metastases
than the E2F1-negative group (Kwon et al., 2010). This is in line
with clinical surveys associating E2F1 expression with improved
survival in patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy for gastric
cancer and colon cancer, underscoring the role of E2F1 as an
endogenous chemosensitizer in cancer patients and potentially
prognostic or predictive factor for clinical outcome and therapeutic
results (Belvedere et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2008). Conversely, E2F1
expression was frequently associated with high grade tumors, unfavorable
patient survival prognosis and tumor progression (Banerjee
et al., 2000; Eymin et al., 2001; Gorgoulis et al., 2002; Han et al.,
2003; Iwamoto et al., 2004; Salon et al., 2007; Yamazaki et al., 2003).
Most strikingly, Lee et al. (2010) showed that high expression of
E2F1 and its associated target genes predict superficial to invasive
progression of bladder tumors in cancer patients. Progression of
superficial tumors to invasive tumors was significantly higher in
the E2F1-high group than in the E2F1-low group. Together with the
finding that E2F binding sites are significantly enriched in promoters
of genes whose expression is strongly associated with invasive
tumors, these data suggest that E2F1 expression is functionally
associated with invasive tumor development (Lee et al., 2010).
Even though in those cases E2F1 expression in conjunction with
chemotherapy was not examined, it is a known fact that cancers
of advanced stage are commonly resistant against chemotherapy.
Therefore, one might speculate that stimuli like DNA damage or
oncogenic stress are required for an efficient tumor suppressor
function of E2F1, and that its overexpression in vivo could be
rather oncogenic than anti-neoplastic when death pathways are
mutated. This notion was substantiated by a new transcriptome
profiling approach, primarily focusing on the discovery of genes
involved in a cooperative perhaps synergistic apoptosis response
between E2F1 and chemotherapeutic drugs in p53-deficient tumor
cells (Engelmann et al., 2010). While these experiments revealed
upregulation of known and hitherto unknown E2F1 death genes, it
D. Engelmann, B.M. Pützer / Drug Resistance Updates 13 (2010) 119–131 127

also uncovered unexpected risks of chemogene therapy for cancer
patients. Importantly, the microarray data demonstrated a synergism
in the upregulation of genes that are related to cell survival
and tumor progression. Based on these results, it is conceivable
that DNA damaging agents also promote oncogene activation in the
context of E2F1 signalling. This assumption was further supported
by the observation that conditional E2F1 activation in transgenic
mice targeted to the testes, which results in the activation of E2F1
target genes and p53-independent apoptosis (testicular atrophy),
caused also premalignant changes resembling carcinoma in situ in
humans (Agger et al., 2005). Although the ability of genotoxic compounds
to transcriptionally induce oncogenes in association with
aberrant E2F1 activity did not affect the net outcome of enhanced
killing of tumor cells in vitro, this potentially carcinogenic side effect
might reduce efficacy of anticancer therapy in patients and favor
tumor recurrence or progression following chemotherapy (Fig. 5A).
Even more important, considering E2F1s natural prosurvival function
in non-proliferating cells, this could eventually lead to tumor
formation in normal tissues.

6.2. Evasion of tumor cells from E2F1-induced apoptosis as a
mechanism of drug resistance

Although E2F1 is a versatile and very potent tumor cell death
inducer, E2F1 does not always induce cell death. Therefore,
increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to
resistance to E2F1-induced apoptosis by chemotherapy is a premise
to improve current anticancer therapies, since anti-apoptotic negative
feedback loops are important ways for tumor evasion (Fig. 5B).
It has been shown that the E2F1 inducible E2F7 and E2F8
proteins cooperate to repress E2F1-dependent apoptosis as amechanism
for cell survival (Li et al., 2008; Moon and Dyson, 2008).
Moreover they counteract the cellular DNA damage response. E2F7
and E2F8 are induced in cells treated with DNA damaging agents
and bind to the promoters of certain E2F-responsive genes, most
notably that of the E2F1 gene, in which E2F7 and E2F8 coexist in
a DNA binding complex (Zalmas et al., 2008). As a consequence,
E2F7 and E2F8 inhibit E2F target genes, and reducing the level of
each subunit results in an increase in E2F1 expression and activity.
Thus E2F7 and E2F8 influence the ability of cells to undergo a DNA
damage response.
An intriguing body of experimental data indicates that oncogenic
PI3K–AKT signalling opposes E2F1 tumor suppressor function
(Hallstrom et al., 2008; Hallstrom and Nevins, 2003). AKT inhibits
E2F1-induced apoptosis indirectly through phosphorylating of
DNA topoisomerase II binding protein 1 (TopBP1) (Liu et al., 2006).
Through its BRCT domain, TopBP1 interacts with and represses
exclusively E2F1 but not E2F2 or E2F3 by recruiting Brg1/Brm,
a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex,
to E2F1-responsive promoters, such as p73, p14ARF (Liu et al.,
2004). This regulation of E2F1 transcriptional activity is crucial in
the control of E2F1-induced apoptosis during normal cell growth
and DNA damage and occurs independent of pRB. The Nevins’
group further analyzed the ability of growth-factor-activated PI3K
signalling to directly regulate E2F1 transcriptional output and
apoptosis induction and identified a subset of E2F1 proapoptotic
targets that are specifically blocked by a serum-activated PI3K-AKT
signalling, while E2F1s genes involved in the proliferative program
were not affected (Hallstrom et al., 2008). This implicates that
oncogenic signalling acts as inhibitor of E2F1’s apoptotic response
in tumor cells. Reduced expression of genes belonging to the
E2F1 apoptotic program in breast and ovarian cancer patients
coincided with significantly poorer survival outcomes, emphasizing
the importance of these events for establishing resistance to
E2F1-induced apoptosis linked with an advanced type of cancer.
Similarly, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling has

Fig. 5. Resistance to E2F1 driven cell death as a mechanism for tumor evasion. E2F1
triggers cell death and acts as a tumor suppressor, but also promotes survival programs
by activating oncogenes. (A) Despite of a potent tumor cell killing effect
of conventional chemotherapy in human cancers with deregulated E2F1 expression
or chemogene (E2F1 + drug) treatment, these therapies have also oncogenic
side-effects, particularly in advanced tumors with disrupted cell death pathways,
that select for apoptosis-resistant phenotypes, tumor recurrence and progression.
(B) Negative feedback loops mediated by E2F1 inducible oncogenic signalling
pathways such as AKT/PI3K and EGFR, epigenetic regulators (e.g. EZH2) and antiapoptotic
effector proteins (KAP1, API5) control E2F1-induced apoptosis in response
to chemotherapy and provide ways for tumor evasion.
128 D. Engelmann, B.M. Pützer / Drug Resistance Updates 13 (2010) 119–131

been implicated in restraining E2F1 apoptotic activity (Moon et al.,
2006), while EGFR itself was recently shown to be activated by E2F1
through a direct transcriptional mechanism, leading to melanoma
metastasis independent from E2F1s proliferative activity (Alla et
al., 2010). Here it appears of interest that TopBP1 and AKT are
also targets of E2F1, suggesting the existence of a self-control
mechanism by which E2F1 modulates its own apoptotic activity
in favor of a pRB-independent prosurvival response (Chaussepied
and Ginsberg, 2004; Yang et al., 2008).
There is evidence that epigenetic events are also involved
in E2F1-triggered anti-apoptotic loops and impede its tumor
suppressor function. The E2F1 inducible oncogenic polycomb histone
methyltransferase EZH2 antagonizes expression of the E2F1
proapoptotic target Bim, thereby dampening E2F1 apoptosis (Wu
et al., 2010). Since EZH2 is induced by doxorubicin treatment in
tumor cells (unpublished data), epigenetic silencing of proapoptotic
E2F1 target genes may contribute to evasion of cancer cells
from drug-induced apoptosis. Knockdown strategies resulting in
gene silencing of EZH2 restored E2F1 apoptotic activity (Wu et al.,
2010), thus providing a new treatment option for cancer.
Another level of regulation during DNA damage comes from
effector proteins that counteract E2F1-induced apoptosis and are
not directly E2F1-dependent. KAP1, for example, is a nuclear
corepressor interacting with chromatin modifying factors that is
phosphorylated by ATM in response to DNA damage. It stimulates
formation of the E2F1–HDAC1 complex, inhibition of E2F1
acetylation and apoptosis (Wang et al., 2007a). More importantly,
depletion of endogenous KAP1 in pRb-deficient cancer cells
increased E2F1 transcriptional activity and sensitized its apoptotic
DNA damage response. Moreover, apoptosis inhibitor-5 (Api5)
was identified as a suppressor of E2F1-induced apoptosis in vivo
(Morris et al., 2006). Api5 functions downstream of E2F1 and does
not inhibit E2F1 transcriptional activity. This E2F–Api5 functional
interaction is conserved from flies to humans, where Api5 expression
is often upregulated in tumor cells, in particular metastatic
cells, suggesting that it can enable tumor cells to evade E2F1-
induced apoptosis.
In this aspect, the identification of physiological regulators of
E2F1-induced apoptosis opens potentially important perspectives
for future anticancer therapies. Specifically, pharmacological attenuation
of signalling routes that block E2F1-induced apoptosis may
lead to selective killing of tumor cells that lack functional RB
but retain operational apoptotic machinery downstream of E2F1.
However, considering the multiple autoregulatory feedback loops
initiated by E2F1 itself, it is paradoxically apparent that E2F1
despite all cancer killing activities has the potential to self-activate
drug resistance. Indeed, there is recent evidence showing that E2F1
can mediate drug (tamoxifen) resistance in human breast cancer
cells (Louie et al., 2010). Consequently, therapies using E2F1 or
even conventional anticancer drug treatments which are primarily
E2F1-dependent will have oncogenic side-effects, especially on
high grade tumors with severe defects in cell death pathways that
may, a priori, select against apoptotic consequences of deregulated
E2F1 activity. Under these conditions E2F1, initially unleashed to
fight cancer, can act as a driving force for tumor progression (Alla

7. Conclusion

Therapeutic success of chemotherapeutic agents depends for a
large part on functional translation of DNA damage into efficient
cancer cell apoptosis induction. Key molecules like E2F1 have been
identified as mediators of these cytotoxic effects in the course of
its cancer defense function. In p53-deficient cells, E2F1 is part of
a failsafe mechanism at the frontier of apoptosis resistance. Up to

recently E2F1 was thought to have a unique tumor suppressor function
within the family of E2F transcription factors, but now it is
evident that E2F3a and E2F2 have important supporting roles. In
this context RB has been characterized to mediate drug-induced
apoptosis in an E2F1-dependent manner. Thus it appears that
E2F1’s ability to induce apoptosis is more deep-seated within the
RB-E2F axis than initially assumed. Although E2F1 apoptosis signalling
is highly conserved and exceedingly complex, paradoxically
the same axis is responsible for an aggressive cancer phenotype,
tumor progression and therapy failure. It seems that during cancer
progression, E2F1 loses its suppressor function thereby unleashing
its oncogenic capabilities that still remain to be determined
in vivo. Mechanisms that lead to an insensitivity of E2F1-induced
apoptosis largely depend on E2F1 itself. This is the major obstacle
for chemogene therapy and is highly relevant for conventional drug
treatment as well. It has to be realized that DNA damage inflicting
agents which are commonly used in current chemotherapy regiments
mainly trigger the E2F–RB axis – a pathway that is highly
carcinogenic. Thus, re-establishment of E2F1s tumor suppressor
function by oncogene inhibitors in conjunction with chemotherapy
might be a useful option for treatment of apoptosis resistant
cancers.
