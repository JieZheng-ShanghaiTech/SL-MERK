Tumorigenesis is a multi-step process that requires activation of
oncogenes and inactivation of tumour suppressor genes1
. Mouse
models of human cancers have recently demonstrated that continuous
expression of a dominantly acting oncogene (for example,
Hras, Kras and Myc) is often required for tumour maintenance2–5;
this phenotype is referred to as oncogene addiction6
.
This concept has received clinical validation by the development
of active anticancer drugs that specifically inhibit the function of
oncoproteins such as BCR-ABL, c-KIT and EGFR7–10. Identifying
additional gene mutations that are required for tumour maintenance
may therefore yield clinically useful targets for new cancer
therapies. Although loss of p53 function is a common feature of
human cancers11, it is not known whether sustained inactivation of
this or other tumour suppressor pathways is required for tumour
maintenance. To explore this issue, we developed a Cre-loxP-based
strategy to temporally control tumour suppressor gene expression
in vivo. Here we show that restoring endogenous p53 expression
leads to regression of autochthonous lymphomas and sarcomas in
mice without affecting normal tissues. The mechanism responsible
for tumour regression is dependent on the tumour type, with

the main consequence of p53 restoration being apoptosis in lymphomas
and suppression of cell growth with features of cellular
senescence in sarcomas. These results support efforts to treat
human cancers by way of pharmacological reactivation of p53.
Biochemical and genetic studies have demonstrated that p53
responds to genotoxic and oncogenic stresses by inducing cell cycle
arrest or apoptosis11. Because oncogenic stress can persist after p53
inactivation, loss of p53 function may not only play a role in the early
stages of tumour development, but also be required for the continued
proliferation or survival of an established tumour12–14. To test this
hypothesis, we used a genetic strategy to restore endogenous p53
expression in primary, autochthonous tumours. Mice carrying a
reactivatable p53 knockout allele were generated by inserting a transcription–translation
stop cassette flanked by loxP sites (LSL) in the
first intron of the endogenous wild-type p53 locus (Fig. 1a, b). When
in place, the STOP cassette efficiently prevents expression of the p53
gene (Fig. 1c, d). Cells from homozygous p53LSL/LSL (referred to
hereafter as p53-LSL) mice are functionally equivalent to p53 null
(p532/2) cells, as demonstrated by the absence of cell-cultureinduced
senescence (Fig. 1e) and by their marked genetic instability

(Fig. 1f). However, owing to the presence of flanking loxP sites, the
STOP cassette can be excised by the Cre recombinase15, thus restoring
expression of the endogenous p53 gene (Fig. 1c, d). Because mice
lacking p53 are tumour-prone16,17, this system offers an opportunity
to study the consequences of p53 reactivation in primary tumours in
vivo.
To temporally control p53 reactivation in vivo, we have also generated
mice carrying a Cre-recombinase-Oestrogen-Receptor-T2
(Cre-ERT2) allele targeted to the ubiquitously expressed ROSA26
locus (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). The ERT2 moiety retains the Cre
recombinase in the cytoplasm until tamoxifen administration
releases this inhibition18, thus permitting the recombination of
genomic loxP sites. Efficient tamoxifen-induced Cre-mediated
recombination throughout the body was demonstrated by crossing
Cre-ERT2 mice to mice carrying a Cre-responsive b-galactosidase
reporter allele19 (Supplementary Fig. 1c).
Next, Cre-ERT2 and p53-LSL mice were crossed to generate
cohorts of p53-LSL homozygous mutant animals carrying the CreERT2
allele (p53LSL/LSL;Cre-recombinase-Oestrogen-Receptor-T2,
hereafter referred to as p53-LSL;Cre-ERT2) as well as p53-LSL homozygotes
without the Cre-ERT2 allele (hereafter referred to as p53-
LSL). To accelerate tumour formation, some of these mice were
irradiated shortly after birth, as radiation decreases tumour latency
in p53 null mice20. These animals underwent periodic magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) to detect the presence of cancer (Fig. 2a).
After tumour detection, the mice were treated with tamoxifen and
then re-imaged at different times thereafter.
As shown in Fig. 2, in the majority of p53-LSL;Cre-ERT2 mice,
tamoxifen treatment caused regression of autochthonous lymphomas
and sarcomas (Fig. 2b, c, f; Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary
Movies). This effect was due to p53 reactivation rather than tamoxifen
treatment alone, because in Cre-ERT2-negative p53-LSL mice,
tumours rapidly progressed despite treatment (Fig. 2d–f). Figure 2f
summarizes the responses observed in the animals studied. Out of 10

Cre-ERT2-positive tumours treated (6 thymic lymphomas, 3 sarcomas
and 1 intra-abdominal lymphoma), 7 showed regression ranging
from 46% to 100%. In two tumours (a thymic lymphoma and an
osteosarcoma), tamoxifen prevented tumour progression but failed
to decrease the size of the neoplasia (Fig. 2f; Supplementary Fig. 3). In
one thymic lymphoma tumour progression was observed despite
tamoxifen treatment (Fig. 2f; Supplementary Fig. 3). DNA and
immunohistochemical analysis indicated that in this case resistance
to tamoxifen was due to the specific deletion of the Cre-ERT2 allele
in the tumour (Supplementary Fig. 3e, f). In contrast, all CreERT2-negative
tumours (two thymic lymphomas, two abdominal
lymphomas and three sarcomas) progressed despite tamoxifen
administration (Fig. 2d–f). These results demonstrate that sustained
p53 inactivation is required for tumour maintenance in autochthonous
lymphomas and sarcomas in the mouse.
To study the mechanisms responsible for tumour regression,
tumours from p53-LSL;Cre-ERT2 mice were analysed 24 or 48 h after
tamoxifen treatment. In thymic lymphomas, tumour regression was
already apparent at 48 h (approximately 75% reduction in tumour
volume; see Fig. 3a). In addition, p53 expression was detectable as
early as 24 h following tamoxifen treatment and was associated with
widespread apoptosis (Fig. 3b). We next derived three thymic lymphoma
cell lines, two from p53LSL/1;Cre-ERT2 mice and one from a
p53-LSL;Cre-ERT2 mouse. An additional line, to be used as a control,
was derived from a thymic lymphoma arising in a p531/2 mouse. In
all cases, p53 expression was undetectable by western blot (data not
shown), suggesting that in the tumours arising in p53LSL/1 and
p531/2 mice expression of the wild-type p53 allele had been lost.
4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) treatment caused cell death in the
p53-LSL;Cre-ERT2-positive cell lines but not in the control cells
(Fig. 3c). A time-course experiment with the p53-LSL;Cre-ERT2 thymic
lymphoma cell line showed that cell death began within 12 h after
4-OHT administration and was virtually complete by 96 h (Fig. 3d).
Moreover, just as the primary thymic lymphomas showed apoptotic

cell death (Fig. 3b), immunoblot for activated caspase-3 and flowcytometry
analysis of annexin-5 positive cells (Fig. 3e and data not
shown) demonstrated that apoptosis was the primary consequence of
p53 reactivation in this context. Interestingly, the cell cycle distribution
of the viable lymphoma cells did not change in response to
4-OHT administration (Fig. 3e), despite induction of the p21 cyclindependent
kinase inhibitor (data not shown).
Compared to lymphomas, sarcoma regression upon tamoxifen
treatment was more delayed, with only a modest reduction at 48 h
(Fig. 4a). Furthermore, although p53 was clearly expressed in the
sarcomas at 24 and 48 h (Fig. 4b and data not shown) extensive
apoptosis was not evident at these time points (Fig. 4b). Despite
the absence of a clear increase in apoptosis, prolonged tamoxifen
treatment led to regression of sarcomas (Fig. 2c, f; Supplementary
Figs 4 and 5), with the residual mass largely composed of necrotic
tissue (Supplementary Fig. 5). In order to determine the mechanism
underlying sarcoma regression, we investigated the consequences of
p53 restoration in two cell lines derived from p53-LSL sarcomas.

Consistent with the results in vivo, expression of Cre recombinase in
these cell lines failed to induce significant apoptosis (Fig. 4c). Instead,
restoration of p53 expression suppressed proliferation (Fig. 4d) and
induced cell cycle arrest (Fig. 4e). In addition, these cells lost their
spindle morphology, appeared flat and enlarged, and many of them
expressed senescence-associated b-galactosidase (Fig. 4f).
Recent work has led to the identification of a number of proteins
whose expression is increased in senescent pre-neoplastic lesions21.
These markers include the cdk-inhibitors p15-Ink4b and p16-Ink4a,
as well as DcR2 and Dec1. We examined their expression in sarcoma
cell lines derived from p53-LSL;Cre-ERT2 and p53-LSL mice. Only
the Cre-ERT2-positive sarcoma cells induced p15-Ink4b, p16-Ink4a,
DcR2 and (to a lesser extent) Dec-1 in response to tamoxifen treatment
(Fig. 4g). We next examined whether cell cycle arrest and senescence
markers are similarly induced by p53 restoration in sarcomas
in vivo. Senescence-associated b-galactosidase positive cells were
observed in one out of three Cre-ERT2-positive sarcomas treated with
tamoxifen for 5–6 days, but in none of the Cre-ERT2-negative controls
(Supplementary Fig. S6, and data not shown). Consistent with
the data obtained in sarcoma cell lines, p15-Ink4b and p16-Ink4a
expression was higher in the tamoxifen-treated Cre-ERT2-positive
sarcomas, compared to the Cre-ERT2-negative ones (Fig. 4h).
Although Ki67 staining was not significantly different after p53 restoration
in these tumours, an analysis of phospho-histone H3
revealed a markedly lower fraction of proliferation in the tamoxifen-treated
Cre-ERT2-positive sarcomas (Fig. 4h and i). Taken
together, these results indicate that the main consequence of p53
restoration in sarcomas is cell cycle arrest with some features of
senescence. We did not observe upregulation of all senescence markers
in every sarcoma studied in vivo, which may reflect the genetic
and histological heterogeneity between the spontaneous mesenchymal
tumours analysed here and epithelial pre-neoplastic lesions
reported by others21. Furthermore, owing to the relatively low incidence
of sarcomas in p53 null animals, our analysis of senescence
markers in vivo has been relatively limited to date. We anticipate that
with further studies of p53 restoration in sarcomas, we will be able to
clarify the arrest/senescent phenotype of different sarcoma subtypes
more fully.
Although tamoxifen treatment of p53-LSL;Cre-ERT2 mice leads to
excision of the STOP cassette in both neoplastic and normal tissues,
expression of the p53 protein was detectable by immunohistochemistry
only in tumour cells (Figs 3b and 4b, and data not shown).
Furthermore, histopathological analysis revealed no signs of p53-
mediated toxicity in normal organs after acute p53 reactivation (data
not shown). These results indicate that in p53 null mice, transformed
cells are uniquely primed to stabilize and activate p53. In established
tumours, one potential stimulus for p53 protein stabilization and
activation is persistent oncogenic stress. Because the tumour suppressor
gene p19Arf is induced in response to oncogenic stimuli and
is a well known activator of p53 (ref. 22), we analysed its expression
levels in tumours from p53-LSL animals. Strikingly, high p19Arf
expression was frequently observed in both lymphomas and sarcomas
but not in the normal tissues analysed (Supplementary Fig. 7 and
data not shown). These results suggest that in lymphomas and
sarcomas, p19Arf might prime tumour cells to respond to p53
reactivation.
In this study, we have used a novel genetic strategy for restoring
endogenous p53 activity in cells and in mice. By combining a reactivatable
loss-of-function p53 allele together with a temporally regulated
Cre recombinase, we demonstrate that sustained inactivation of
p53 is required for the maintenance of primary, autochthonous lymphomas
and sarcomas. This approach may be of general application
for the study of other tumour suppressor gene pathways.
Interestingly, the mechanism of tumour regression after p53 restoration
appears to be tumour type specific. In lymphomas, restoration
of p53 caused widespread apoptosis, whereas the major
consequence of p53 reactivation in sarcomas was cell cycle arrest with

features of cellular senescence. Because sarcomas also regressed following
p53 reactivation in vivo, it is possible that senescent cells are
rapidly cleared from the tumour mass. This hypothesis is consistent
with results obtained in a mouse model of liver cancer in an accompanying
paper23. Alternatively, sarcoma regression may be a consequence
of p53-dependent effects on tumour vasculature24,25 or on
other stromal components. The effect is also tumour specific in that
normal cells appeared not to respond to p53 reactivation. Thus, this
represents an extremely promising anticancer strategy with a broad
therapeutic window.
These results are also consistent with work in other model systems.
For example, mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) transformed by ectopically
expressing an oncogenic K-Ras allele in the setting of doxycycline-regulated
p53 knock-down enter senescence upon restoration
of p53 expression26. Tumours obtained by injecting these cells into
nude mice also regressed in response to doxycycline treatment26.
Likewise, immortalized MEFs from a p53–oestrogen-receptor(tamoxifen)
fusion knock-in mouse strain undergo senescence after
treatment with tamoxifen27, and temporarily activating p53 in these
mice delays tumour development28.
Owing to the prevalence of p53 pathway inactivation in human
cancers, several pharmacological strategies aimed at restoring p53
function have been proposed. These include small molecules that
restore point-mutant p53 proteins to a transcriptionally competent
conformation13, as well as compounds that interfere with the Mdm2–
p53 interaction29 and gene-therapy-based approaches aimed at introducing
a wild-type copy of the p53 gene into tumour cells30. Provided
that human cancers, like the mouse cancers studied here, remain
dependent on sustained p53 inactivation for tumour maintenance,
our results lend strong support to such therapeutic efforts.

METHODS
A detailed description of materials and methods is given in Supplementary
Information.
Generation of p53-LSL mice. The p53-LSL allele was obtained as a by-product
of our efforts to generate a R270H point mutant p53 allele31. All p53 exons and
intron–exon boundaries were sequenced to ensure the absence of mutations.
Oligonucleotide sequences for genotyping are available on request.
Generation of R26-Cre-ERT2 mice. A plasmid containing the Cre-ERT2 complementary
DNA (pCre-ERT2) was obtained from the laboratory of P.
Chambon19. This cDNA was targeted to the ROSA26 locus as described in detail
in the Supplementary Information.
Tamoxifen treatment. All animal studies and procedures were approved by the
MIT Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and by the Subcommittee
on Research Animal Care at Massachusetts General Hospital. Mice were of a
mixed 129Sv/Jae and C57/B6 background. After detecting a tumour by MRI,
mice were treated with tamoxifen (Sigma) by intraperitoneal injection. 100 ml of
tamoxifen (10 mg ml21 in corn oil) was injected every two to three days. Followup
MRI was generally obtained 7–10 days after the first tamoxifen treatment.
MRI and tumour volume analysis. All animals were sequentially imaged using a
4.7 T Bruker Pharmascan (Bruker BioSpin) to screen for tumour growth and
treatment response to tamoxifen. Tumour volume measurements were performed
using T1- and T2-weighted coronal and axial image stacks. The tumours
were manually segmented using Amira software (TGS) to obtain the tumour
volume in cm3
. For each time point, all measurements from the available
sequences were used to calculate a mean volume 6 standard deviation in order
to limit errors due to the manual segmentation process.
