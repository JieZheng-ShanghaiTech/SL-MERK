The p53 tumor suppressor gene plays a key role in prevention of tumor formation through transcriptional
dependent and independent mechanisms. Transcriptional-dependent mechanisms are mainly mediated by p53
regulation of downstream targets, leading to growth arrest and apoptosis. Mutational inactivation of the p53 gene is
detected in more than 50% of human cancers. Mutation of p53 renders cancer cells more resistant to current cancer
therapies due to lack of p53-mediated apoptosis. Extensive studies have been conducted to identify small molecules
that manipulate p53, including restoration of mutant p53 conformation to wild-type, disruption of murine double
minute-2 (Mdm2)-p53 binding to increase p53 level and inhibition of Mdm2 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity to prevent p53
degradation. Another approach was to identify and validate ‘‘drugable’’ target(s) in p53 signaling pathways that
modulate p53-induced apoptosis. We profiled a p53 temperature-sensitive lung cancer cell model with the Affymetrix
human HG-U133 GeneChip, covering the entire human transcriptome. We identified thousands of unique genes that
were either induced or repressed in response to p53-induced apoptosis. A follow-up study characterized a p53-
repressed gene, SAK, a polo-like kinase (PLK) family member, as an appealing cancer drug target. Snk/Plk-akin kinase
(SAK) silencing via small interfering RNA (siRNA) induced apoptosis, whereas SAK overexpression attenuated p53-
induced apoptosis. Thus, SAK repression by p53 contributes to p53-induced apoptosis. Future work is directed at
determining the normal cell response to SAK silencing. If a therapeutic window is obtained, a SAK inhibitor identified
from high throughput screening (HTS) could serve as a lead compound for development of a novel class of apoptosisinducing
anticancer drugs.  2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

INTRODUCTION
Apoptosis is a genetically programmed process of
cell death required for maintaining homeostasis
under physiological conditions and for responding
to various internal and external stimuli. Cells
committed to apoptosis are characterized by membrane
blebbing, cytoplasmic shrinkage, nuclear
chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation
[1]. Cancer is associated with decreased apoptosis,
and development of apoptosis resistance in cancer
cells is a significant contributing factor to the failure
of cancer therapies. Thus, induction of apoptosis in
apoptosis-resistant cancer cells through a variety of
approaches would be an ideal strategy for effective
cancer therapy [2,3]. One promising approach to
achieve this end is through the modulation of p53 or
the components of p53 signaling pathways.
The p53 protein is known to act biochemically as
a transcription factor and biologically as a tumor
suppressor. p53 specifically binds to a consensus
DNA binding sequence, consisting of repeats of the
10 bp motif 50
-PuPuPuC(A/T)(T/A)GPyPyPy-30
,
located in the promoter or introns of its downstream
target genes and thus transactivates the expression of

these genes. The biological functions of p53 are
mainly mediated through transcriptional regulation
of its downstream target genes. For example, p53-
induced growth arrest is achieved mainly by transactivation
of p21 (for G1 arrest), of 14-3-3s (for G2
arrest), and of placenta transforming growth factorbeta
(PTGF-b). p53-induced apoptosis, on the other
hand, is mediated by activation of genes involved in
two major apoptotic pathways: (1) the mitochondrial
pathway, with genes such as BAX, NOXA,
PUMA, p53AIP1, PIGs, and APAF-1; and (2) the death
receptor pathway, with genes such as KILLER/DR5,
FAS, and PIDD. p53 also transcriptionally represses
cell survival genes, such as IGFR, BCL-2, or survivin,

leading to apoptosis induction [4,5]. Furthermore,
a number of recent studies have shown that cytoplasmic
p53 can regulate apoptosis in a transcriptionally
independent manner through binding to
mitochondria and modulating the Bcl-2 homolog
region-3 (BH3) family of proapoptotic proteins such
as BAX [6,7]. Figure 1 illustrates the p53 signaling
pathways in the regulation of growth arrest and
apoptosis.
As a key regulator of cell growth and cell death, p53
is activated by many environmental stimuli, including
DNA-damaging agents. Activated p53 acts as a
guardian of the genome by inducing growth arrest to
allow cells to repair the damage or apoptosis, if the
damage is too severe and irreparable [8]. Thus, not
surprisingly, p53 is frequently inactivated via multiple
mechanisms during human carcinogenesis. The
most common mechanism of p53 inactivation is
mutation at the p53 gene, which occurs in more than
50% of all human cancers. Moreover, in some cancer
cells that bear a wild-type p53, p53 is nonfunctional,
either being targeted for degradation by overexpression
of murine double minute-2 (Mdm2), an E3
ubiquitin ligase that binds to p53, or by being
excluded from the nucleus where p53 acts as a
transcription factor [4].
p53 AS A DIRECT DRUG TARGET
Due to its pivotal role in controlling abnormal cell
growth and its frequent inactivation in a majority of

human cancers, p53 has been a central cancer target
for mechanism-driven novel cancer drug discovery.
Several different approaches aiming at p53 reactivation
or mutant p53 elimination have been
attempted. One approach is to restore wild-type
p53 conformation in mutant p53-containing cancer
cells by small molecule compounds. At least two
classes of compounds have been identified so far, CP31398
and PRIMA-1 [9,10]. CP-31398 was identified
through a screening based upon an in vitro biochemical
assay that detects wild-type or mutant p53
conformation via two specific antibodies [9],
whereas PRIMA-1 was identified through a cell-based
assay by monitoring cell growth inhibition [10].
Indeed, at a high drug concentration, both compounds
were found to restore p53 conformation and
to induce growth arrest or apoptosis in a subset of
cancer cells or to sensitize cancer cells to radio- and
chemotherapies [9,10]. However, the selectivity,
specificity, and mechanism of action of these
compounds are still unclear. The second approach
is to disrupt Mdm2-p53 binding by small molecules,
thus activating wild-type p53. Three such compounds,
Nutlin, RITA, and a nonpeptide Mdm2
inhibitor, with distinct chemical structures, were
reported [11–13]. These compounds bind to Mdm2
or p53 in the p53-binding pocket and release p53
from Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation. Mechanistically,
these compounds will only work in human
cancers harboring a wild-type p53 and preferentially

Figure 1. p53 signaling pathways for growth arrest and apoptosis:
Under unstressed conditions, the p53 level is very low in cells due to
MDM2 binding and degradation. Upon DNA damage by ionizing
radiation or anticancer drugs, p53-MDM2 binding is dissociated as a
result of p53 phosphorylation by ATM and acetylation by p300/
pCAF, leading to p53 activation. Activated p53 acts as a transcription
factor to transactivate growth regulatory genes such as p21
and 14-3-3s to induce growth arrest. p53 regulates apoptosis in

transcriptional-dependent and -independent manners. Under a
transcriptional-dependent mechanism, p53 induces apoptosis by
transactivating the genes in both mitochondrial and death receptor
pathways as well as trans repressing cellular survival genes such as
IGFR and BCL-2. Under a transcriptional-independent mechanism,
p53 binds to mitochondria and modulates activity of BH3-containing
proapoptotic proteins.

with Mdm2 overexpression. The third approach is to
identify inhibitors of the Mdm2 E3 ubiquitin ligase,
aiming at inhibiting Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation.
One such compound, HLI98, was recently
reported [14]. The compound stabilized p53 and
Mdm2 and activated p53-dependent transcription
and apoptosis with some p53-independent cytotoxicity.
Again, the compound worked much better in
wild-type p53-containing cancer cells than those
with a mutant p53 [14]. Nevertheless, the compounds
that activate wild-type p53 through disrupting
or inhibiting Mdm2 have an intrinsic risk to be
toxic to wild-type p53-containing normal cells. The
fourth approach is to eliminate mutant p53 via
Hsp90-active agents such as geldanamycin [15] and
via induced degradation by histone deacetylase
(HDAC) inhibitors, such as trichostatin [16]. However,
depletion of mutant p53 cannot and does not
restore p53 functions, although it may abolish the
gain-of-function effect of mutant p53.
CANCER DRUG TARGETS IN p53
SIGNALING PATHWAYS
An ideal cancer target will meet the following
criteria: (1) it plays an essential role in carcinogenesis,
and/or is required for the maintenance of cancer
cell phenotype, and/or is apoptosis protective and
renders cancer cells resistant to apoptosis; (2) it is
activated or overexpressed in cancer cells and its
activation or overexpression is associated with a poor
prognosis of patient survival; (3) inhibition of its
expression or activity induces growth suppression
and/or apoptosis in cancer cells; (4) it is preferably
‘‘drugable;’’ that is, it is an enzyme or G proteincoupled
receptor (GPCR) or a cell surface molecule,
which can be easily screened with a high throughput
for small molecular inhibitors or targeted by specific
antibodies; and (5) importantly, it is either not
expressed or is only expressed at a very low level in
normal cells and its inhibition has a minimal effect
on normal cell growth and function. Inhibition of
such a target would achieve a maximal therapeutic
index with a minimal toxicity.
Based upon the above criteria, p53 is not an ideal
direct cancer drug target, because it is a tumor
suppressor and a transcription factor. An alternative
approach will be to identify ‘‘drugable’’ p53 downstream
targets that regulate p53-induced apoptosis,
followed by drug screening of their chemical inhibitors
for anticancer drug discovery. Two categories of
genes that are responsive to p53-induced apoptosis
are expected to be identified. The first category
will be those that are transactivated by p53. These
genes can be further subgrouped into apoptosisinducing
genes such as BAX, p53-upregulated modulator
of apoptosis (PUMA), or NOXA (see Figure 1)
or apoptosis-inhibiting genes, such as heparinbinding
EGF-like growth factor [17], Cox-2 [18], or
discoidin domain receptor 1 [19]. Induction of these

genes by p53 is believed to counter-act p53-induced
apoptosis as a cellular defensive mechanism. The
genes that are transrepressed by p53 fall into the
second category, which can also be subgrouped into
apoptosis-inducing genes such as endothelial cell
nitric-oxide synthase [20] or p53-interacting protein
p53BP2 [21] and apoptosis-inhibiting genes, such as
insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR), BCL-2,
or survivin (Figure 1). Although apoptosis-inducing
genes can be used as anticancer agents through a
gene therapy approach or to elucidate apoptosis
signaling pathways, the direct pharmaceutical targets
for small molecule intervention have to come
from the apoptosis-inhibiting genes. Indeed, the
inhibitors of BCL-2 and IGFR as cancer therapeutic
agents are under extensive discovery and development
[22,23].

CHIP-PROFILING TO IDENTIFY NOVEL CANCER DRUG
TARGETS IN p53 SIGNALING PATHWAYS
To further identify novel ‘‘drugable’’ cancer drug
targets in p53 signaling pathways, we used a p53-
temperature sensitive lung cancer cell model [24]
after a detailed characterization. H1299 lung carcinoma
cells (p53-null) were transfected with a mutant
p53A138V, which is temperature sensitive. The p53
in these cells adopts a mutant conformation at 398C
and a wild-type conformation at 328C. Shifting the
culture temperature from 39 to 328C restores the
wild-type p53 conformation, as confirmed by induction
of p53 target genes, p21 and Mdm2, induction
of p53 transactivation, and induction of growth
arrest. Induction of apoptosis only occurs in the
presence of DNA damaging agents [25]. The advantage
of this model is the ability to use the same cancer
line with differences only in p53 status, dependent
upon culture temperature. Changes due to temperature
shift can be easily eliminated by including a
control line that undergoes the same temperature
shift in the experiment. Using this model we profiled
the Affymatrix gene chip HG-U133, consisting of
39 000 genes that cover the entire human transcriptome,
in an attempt to identify genes that respond to
p53-induced growth arrest or apoptosis. As shown in
Table 1, which summarizes the detailed experimental
design, cells were grown at 398C and switched to
328C for 6 h (early), 16 h (intermediate), or 24 h (late)
in the absence (to induce growth arrest) or in the
presence of etoposide (to induce apoptosis). As a
temperature control, H1299-Neo control cells were
similarly treated. A total of 24 sets of chips were used
for profiling. Comparisons among samples 1–6 and
13–18 were made in order to identify specific
genes that respond to p53-induced growth arrest
with elimination of false positives associated with
temperature shifting. Similarly, the comparison
among samples 7–12 and 19–24 was made to
identify specific genes that respond to p53-induced
apoptosis with elimination of those that respond to

etoposide, regardless of p53 status. After subtraction
from controls for temperature shifting or etoposide
treatment, a total of 2977 genes were identified as
being either induced or repressed by p53-induced
growth arrest, 3033 genes by p53-induced apoptosis,
and 1057 genes by both growth arrest and apoptosis
by greater than twofold in at least one given time
point. Approximately, one half of the responsive
genes were induced, whereas the other half was
repressed. Among 113 common genes that respond
to both arrest and apoptosis at all three time points,
10 are well-known p53 targets, including p21,
MDM2, growth arrest and DNA damage-45
(GADD45), cyclin G1, NOXA, BTG, DDB48, activating
transcription factor-3 (ATF3), and two p53-
induced genes (PIG) genes (ferredoxin reductase
and quinone oxidoreductase). This indicated that
our cell model and chip profiling method produce
the expected response for known p53-related genes
and thus are reliable for identifying genes not known
to be regulated by p53 [25].
Previously some p53 target genes were noticed as
being preferentially responsive to growth arrest,
whereas others were responsive to apoptosis. To
compare the expression patterns of genes that are
responsive to growth arrest and apoptosis, we
performed hierarchical clustering analysis based
upon similar patterns of gene expression (Figure 2).
The genes in the analysis were selected if they were
differentially expressed with at least a twofold
change at all three time points under growth arrest

conditions and at all three time points under
apoptosis conditions. A total of 113 genes were
identified and all 89 known transcripts, representing
66 unique genes were analyzed. The red color
indicates increased expression and blue color represents
decreased expression. The magnitude of the
change is depicted by the intensity of color. This
analysis gave rise to five clusters of genes. Cluster 1
consists of a group of genes that showed a higher
induction under growth arrest conditions, particularly
at the intermediate or later time points and
included genes such as connective tissue growth
factor (CTGF). Cluster 2 contains a group of genes
that again showed higher induction under growth
arrest conditions, but at the early time point, and
include genes such as ethanolamine kinase (EKI1).
Cluster 3 consists of genes that showed higher
expression under apoptosis conditions at all time
points, and include genes such as quinone oxidoreductase
(PIG3) and ferredoxin reductase (FDXR),
two well-known apoptosis-associated genes, whereas
cluster 4 consists of genes that showed a similar
induction level between the two growth conditions,
and included genes such as BTG2 and Gadd45.
Cluster 5 consists of genes whose expression was
downregulated in both growth conditions, and
included ID1 and ID3 (inhibitor of DNA binding).
Thus, cluster analysis of the chip profiling data
revealed a group of genes that is preferably induced
during growth arrest conditions, whereas others are
preferably induced by apoptosis.

CHARACTERIZATION OF SAK AS A p53-REPRESSED
GENE: MECHANISM OF ACTION

Among many p53-repressed genes, we selected
Snk/Plk-akin kinase (SAK) for further detailed characterization,
because SAK appears to meet some of
criteria defined as an ideal cancer drug target. First of
all, SAK, also called Plk4, encodes a new member
of the polo-like kinases (PLKs) with other members
including PLK-1, PLK-2/Snk, and PLK-3/Fnk/Prk,
known to play pivotal roles in cell cycle regulation,
specifically in the control of entry and exit of mitosis
[26]. Secondly, SAK is a kinase with a Ser/Thr kinase
domain at the N-terminus and is thus ‘‘drugable’’
[27,28]. Thirdly, SAK is highly expressed in colon
cancers, compared to adjacent normal intestinal
mucosa [29]. Lastly, SAK knock-out studies showed
that SAK expression appears to be required for the
cellular exit from mitosis through the APC-dependent
inactivation of the Cdc2/cyclinB complex [27]
and SAK haploinsufficiency causes mitotic infidelity

and carcinogenesis [30]. Thus, manipulation of SAK
level is likely to disturb well-coordinated cell cycle
progression, leading to cell death.
After confirming the chip data in H1299 p53
temperature sensitive model using Northern analysis
to show a SAK repression by wild-type p53, we went
on to demonstrate that SAK expression was also
downregulated by wild-type p53 in several cancer
cell models, indicating a wild-type p53-dependent,
rather than cell line-dependent downregulation.
Gene repression induced by p53 is known to fall
mechanistically into three general categories. First,
p53 may directly bind to a promoter through either
its consensus binding site or other sites that overlap
with some cis-elements such as E2F, SP-1, or HNF3.
Secondly, p53 may interact with a transcription
factor in the promoter and interfere with its normal
function of transactivation. Third, p53 may directly
interact with some factors of the basal transcription
machinery such as TBP. The binding of p53 to these
factors could recruit a HDAC complex to the

These genes were differentially expressed with at least a twofold change at all three time points under growth
arrest and apoptosis conditions. Each column represents a treatment condition and each row represents a
transcript of the gene. The degree of fold change in gene expression is represented by different colors. The red
color indicates increased expression and the blue color represents decreased expression.

minimal promoter region and cause repression of
transcription. Such repression may be reversed in the
presence of HDAC inhibitors.
To further characterize the molecular basis of SAK
p53 repression, we cloned a 1.7 kb SAK promoter
sequence and identified three putative p53 binding
sites. However, both the in vitro gel retardation assay
and the in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation
assay revealed that p53 does not bind to any of these
sites, indicating SAK repression by p53 did not occur
through a direct p53 binding to the promoter.
Transcriptional analysis with luciferase reporters
driven by a series of SAK promoter deletion fragments
identified SP-1 and CREB binding sites, which
together conferred a twofold SAK repression by p53.
However, the repression was not reversed by cotransfection
of SP-1 or CREB, suggesting a lack of interference
between p53 and SP-1 or CREB, which
excluded the second possibility. Significantly, p53-
mediated SAK repression was largely reversed in a
dose-dependent manner by Trichostatin A, a potent
HDAC inhibitor, suggesting an involvement of
HDAC transcription repressors in SAK repression by
p53 [31].
SAK, AN APPEALING CANCER DRUG TARGET?
To understand the biological significance of SAK
repression by p53 during apoptosis, we knocked
down SAK expression using small interfering RNA
(siRNA) and looked for phenotype changes. HeLa
cells were transfected with two SAK RNAi (K1 and K2)
and a semiquantitative RT-PCR study revealed that
K1, but not K2, caused a significant reduction of
endogenous SAK expression. Accompanying the SAK
reduction, morphological signs of apoptosis appeared
in K1-, but not K2-transfected cells. A
quantitative DNA fragmentation assay showed
that indeed K1siRNA, but not K2siRNA, induced
apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, SAK
repression probably contributes to p53-induced
apoptosis [31].
If SAK repression is critical for p53-mediated
apoptosis induction, one would expect that overexpression
of SAK should block or attenuate the
effect of p53. To test this hypothesis, we went on to
establish SAK stable lines by transfecting a SAKexpressing
plasmid or vector control into wt p53-
containing U2-OS cells. Two independent SAK overexpressing
clones, along with a vector control clone,
were then subjected to etoposide treatment to induce
p53, followed by a gel assay for DNA fragmentation,
a hallmark of apoptosis. Etoposide
treatment significantly induced DNA fragmentation
in U2-OS vector control cells. The degree of DNA
fragmentation was significantly reduced in both SAK
overexpressing clones, indicating that SAK overexpression
attenuates p53-induced apoptosis. Thus,
SAK repression by p53 contributes to p53-induced
apoptosis [31].

SAK has been previously shown to be overexpressed
in colon cancer tissues. Our work presented
here showed that silencing of SAK level could induce
apoptosis in cancer cells. Further validation of SAK
as a cancer target requires determination of the
normal cellular response to SAK elimination via
siRNA silencing. If a differential apoptotic response
between normal and cancer cells can be established,
which is the basis for therapeutic index, SAK could be
an appealing cancer drug target.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
Overall, chip profiling in combination with
knowledge-based computer analysis provided us
with a wealth of information on genes or signaling
pathways possibly involved in p53-induced growth
arrest and apoptosis. This will lead to a better
understanding of p53 biological functions and its
mechanism of action. The gene list derived from this
genome-wide expression profiling and analysis provides
a solid basis for further characterization and
functional assays of each individual gene or several
genes in a particular pathway as potential p53
targets. SAK, as an example presented here, appears
to be a promising target if its manipulation in normal
cells shows a minimal effect. Thus, we hope our
study can provide a battery of potential targets
for further characterization as novel gene-targeted
cancer therapies with an ultimate goal to discover
and develop a novel class of apoptosis-inducing
anticancer drugs.
