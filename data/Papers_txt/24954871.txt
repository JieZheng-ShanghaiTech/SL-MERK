Background: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors show favorable clinical response in some
patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have no EGFR mutation, indicating alternative
mechanisms for their tumoricidal effects. We previously showed erlotinib, a selective EGFR antagonist,
inhibited the growth of sensitive hepatocellular carcinoma cells by inhibiting the cancerous inhibitor of
protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) pathway. The aim of this study was to determine if erlotinib can also
inhibit the growth of NSCLC cells by inactivating the CIP2A-dependent signaling pathway.
Methods: Four NSCLC cell lines (H358 H441 H460 andA549) were treated with erlotinib to determine their
sensitivity to erlotinib-induced cell death and apoptosis. Expression of CIP2A and the downstream AKT
were analyzed. The effects of CIP2A on erlotinib-induced apoptosis were confirmed by overexpression
of CIP2A and knockdown of CIP2A gene expression in the sensitive cells and resistant cells, respectively.
In vivo efficacy of erlotinib against H358 xenograft tumor was also determined in nude mice.
Results: Erlotinib induced significant cell death and apoptosis in H358 and H441 cells, as evidenced by
increased caspase 3 activity and cleavage of pro-caspase 9 and PARP, but not in H460 or A549 cells. The
apoptotic effect of erlotinib in the sensitive H358 cells was associated with downregulation of CIP2A,
increase in PP2A activity and decrease in AKT phosphorylation. Overexpression of CIP2A and AKT protected
the sensitive H358 cells from erlotinib-induced apoptosis. Knockdown of CIP2A gene expression by siRNA
enhanced the erlotinib-induced apoptotic in the resistant H460 cells that resembled the sensitive H358
cells. Erlotinib also inhibited the growth of H358 tumors in nude mice.
Conclusions: The CIP2A-dependent pathway mediates the tumoricidal effects of erlotinib on NSCLC cells
without EGFR mutations in vitro and in vivo. CIP2A may be a novel molecular target against NSCLC for
future drug development.

1. Introduction

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide
and 80% oflung cancers are diagnosed as NSCLC [1]. Epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations are identified in
10–15% of Caucasian NSCLC patients and even higher percentages
in Asian patients [2]. Patients with certain EGFR mutations, such as
L858R and exon 19 deletion have a higher response rate to the EGFR

targeted drugs, such as gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva)
[3–6]. However, some NSCLC patients without EGFR mutations still
respond to gefitinib and erlotinib [7,8], suggesting that there may
be mechanism(s) other than the EGFR-pathway that mediates the
tumoricidal effects of gefitinib and erlotinib. The exact mechanisms
are unclear.
Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) was originally
identified as a cellular PP2A inhibitor that inhibits proteolytic
degradation of c-MYC [9]. CIP2A is overexpressed in several human
malignancies including HCC, gastric cancer, head and neck cancer,
colon cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer and non-small cell
lung cancer [9–17]. Importantly, overexpression of CIP2A in NSCLC
correlates with poor prognosis [14–16]. The decrease of CIP2A and
downstream inactivation of the AKT pathway can inhibit proliferation
and induce apoptosis in a variety of lung cancer cells [15].
In our previous study, we showed that erlotinib, a selective EGFR
inhibitor, inhibited the growth of sensitive hepatocellular carcinoma
cells by causing CIP2A dependent PP2A activation and p-AKT
downregulation, but not in resistant cells [18]. In this study, we
hypothesized that the CIP2A-dependent p-AKT pathway mediates
the anti-tumor activity of erlotinib in NSCLC cells.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Cell lines and culture

Four NSCLC cell lines were used in this study. The H358 cell line
was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas,
VA) and the A549, H441, and H460 cell lines were from the
Bioresource Collection and Research Center (Hsinchu, Taiwan). The
characteristics of each cell lines are listed in Table 1. The NSCLC cell
lines were kept in RPMI1640 (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Saint
Aubin, France) supplemented with 10% FBS (GIBO/Life Technologies,
Grand Island, NY), 100 units/mL penicillin G, and 100 g/mLstreptomycin
sulfate in a 37 ◦C humidified incubator with 5% CO2
in air.

2.2. Reagents and antibodies

Erlotinib (Tarceva®) was purchased from Selleck chemicals
(Houston, TX). For in vitro studies, erlotinib at various concentrations
were dissolved in DMSO and then added to the cells
in serum-free RPMI1640. PP2A inhibitor and activator were purchased
from Sigma and Merck Millipore, respectively. Antibodies
for immunoblotting such as anti-CIP2A, AKT and PARP were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (San Diego, CA). p-AKT
(Ser473) and caspase-9 were from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA).

2.3. Cell viability assay and apoptosis analysis

Four NSCLC cells were seeded in 96-well plates
(3 × 103 cells/well). To determine cell viability and proliferation,
10% WST-1 (water-soluble tetrazolium monosodium salt)
(Cell Proliferation Reagent WST-1; Roche applied science, Indianapolis,
IN) agent was added to the cell suspension in each well,

incubated for 1–2 h, and quantified by measuring the absorbance at
450 nm using a Biotek Synergy HT ELISA reader (Biotek, Winooski,
VT) to calculate the optical density (OD) values. Apoptotic cells
were measured by flow cytometry (sub-G1) and cell death was
detected by Western blot. Caspase-3 activity was measured by
caspase 3 assay kit (colorimetric) from Abcam (Paris, France).

2.4. Overexpression of CIP2A

CIP2A cDNA (KIAA1524) was purchased from OriGene
(Rockville, MD). Briefly, following transfection, H358 cells were
incubated in the presence of G418 (0.78 mg/mL) (Sigma–Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO). After 8 weeks of selection, surviving colonies,
i.e., those arising from stably transfected cells were selected and
individually amplified. H358 cells with stable overexpression of
CIP2A was treated with erlotinib, harvested, and processed for
Western blot analysis.

2.5. PP2A phosphatase activity

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity was measured in fresh
cells as described previously [20] using PP2A DuoSet IC activity
assay kit according to the manufacturer’s description (R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN). Briefly, an immobilized capture antibody
specific for the catalytic subunit of PP2A that binds both active and
inactive PP2A was used. After washing, a substrate is added that is
dephosphorylatedby active PP2Ato generate freephosphate, which
is detected by a sensitive dye-binding assay using malachite green
and molybdic acid.

2.6. Gene knockdown using siRNA and cell transfection

Smart-pool siRNA, including control (sc-37007), CIP2A and PP2A
were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (San Diego, CA).
Cells were transfected with siRNAto afinal concentration of 100 nM
in six-well plates with the Dharma-FECT4 transfection reagent
(Dharmacon, Chicago, IL). After 48 h, the medium was replaced and
the cancer cells were irradiated and harvested for analysis by western
blot and flow cytometry to measure apoptosis. CIP2A cDNA
(KIAA1524) was purchased from OriGene (RC219918, Rockville,
MD). Following transfection, H460 and H358 cells were incubated
in the presence of 0.78 mg/mL G418 (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) to select the stably transfected clones. Those cells that stably
expressed CIP2A-myc were used for treatment with erlotinib as
indicated.

2.7. Quantification of CIP2A gene expression

Total RNA was extracted from H358 and H460 cells (approximately
5 × 106) followed by erlotinib treatment using RNeasy
mini kit (Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD) then reverse transcribed by
using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen, Gaithersburg,
MD). The real time quantitative PCR was performed on an Applied
Roter-Gene 3000 detector (Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD) with a specific
primer set for each target gene and SYBR Green dye (Qiagen,

Gaithersburg, MD) for detection as described in the manufacturer’s
guidelines. The PCR primer sets for target genes were as follows:
human CIP2A (Hs KIAA1524 QuantiTect Primer Assay, NM 020890)
and human actin (Hs ACTB QuantiTect Primer Assay, NM 001101).
An aliquot of each sample was analyzed by quantitative PCR for
ˇ-actin to normalize for inefficiencies in cDNA synthesis and RNA
input amounts. For each sample, the average threshold (Ct) value
was determined from quadruplicate assays, and the Ct
value was
determined by subtracting the average ˇ-actin Ct value from the
average CIP2A Ct value. Three independent experiments were performed
to measure the levels of CIP2A of H358 cells with differential
time treatment.

2.8. Dual-luciferase reporter assay

To verify the transcriptional activity between the erlotinibsensitive
(H358) and erlotinib-resistance (H460) cells, the promoter
activity of CIP2A was determined using the dual-luciferase
reporter assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). H358 and H460 cells
were co-transfected in six-well plates with 2 g
of DNA, including
the luciferase reporter construct pGL4.17-CIP2A-promoter (firefly
fluorescence reporter) and pRL-TK plasmid (renilla fluorescence
reporter) as indicator for normalization of transfection efficiency,
at a ratio of 9:1. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the cells were
add or not variously doses of erlotinib. After 24 h, cells lysed were
collection and the luciferase activity was quantified according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells co-transfected with pGL4.17-
basic plasmids combined with the pRL-TK were used as a negative
control. The promoter activity was repeated three times in parallel
for statistical analysis.

2.9. Xenograft tumor growth

Male NCr nude mice (5–7 weeks of age) were used. All experimental
procedures using these mice were performed according
to protocols approved by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care
and Use Committee of Cardinal Tien Hospital. Each mouse was
inoculated subcutaneously in the dorsal flank with 1 × 107 H358
cells suspended in 0.1 mL of serum-free medium containing 50%
Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA). When tumors reached
100–200 mm3, the mice received erlotinib (10 mg/kg) p.o. once
daily. The controls received vehicle. The tumors were measured
twice weekly using calipers and their volumes calculated using the
following standard formula: width × length × height × 0.523 [18].

2.10. Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s subtest. The results were expressed
as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Differences were considered
significant at *P < 0.05.

3. Results

3.1. Differential effects of erlotinib on viability and apoptosis in
NSCLC cells without EGFR mutation

To investigate the antitumor effect of erlotinib on NSCLC cell
lines, we first assessed the effect of treatment with erlotinib on
growth inhibition in human NSCLC cell lines. As shown in Fig. 1A,
erlotinib exhibited differential effects on the viability of the cells.
Erlotinib caused a dose- and time-dependent reduction in cell viability
in H358 and H441 cells, whereas H460 and A549 cells were
more resistant. As shown in Fig. 1B, erlotinib induced significant
apoptosis in H358 and H441 cells in a dose- and time-dependent
manner. However, H460 and A549 cells did not show significant

apoptosis with erlotinib treatment (Fig. 1B). In the sensitive cell
line, erlotinib cleaved procaspase-9 in H358 cells, which led to
the appearance of caspase-9, and cleaved PARP in both H358 and
H441 cells (Fig. 1C). These were not seen in the resistant H460
and A549 cells. The activity of caspase-3, another apoptosis-related
gene, was also measured. Erlotinib elevated caspase-3 activity in a
dose-dependent manner in H358 and H441cells, but not in H460 or
A549 cells (Fig. 1D). Erlotinib caused cell fragmentation in a dosedependent
manner in the H358 and H441cells, but not in H460 or
A549 cells (Fig. 1E). In annexin-V/propidium iodide double-staining
assay, erlotinib induced significant apoptosis in H358 in a dosedependent
manner, but not in H460 (Supplementary Fig. 1). Taken
together, these results suggest that erlotinib induces apoptosis and
cell death in H358 and H441 cells, despite their lack of EGFR mutation.Supplementary
figure related to this article can be found, in the
online version, at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lungcan.2014.05.024.

3.2. Downregulation of CIP2A determines erlotinib-induced
p-AKT inhibition and apoptosis in NSCLC cells without EGFR
mutation

Next we investigated the role of CIP2A in erlotinib-induced apoptosis
in the sensitive NSCLC cells. As shown in Fig. 2A and C,
erlotinib decreased CIP2A protein levels and AKT phosphorylation
and induced apoptosis in the erlotinib-sensitive H358 cells in dosedependent
and time-dependent manner. In contrast, erlotinib did
not significantly affect levels of CIP2A protein or AKT phosphorylation
in the resistant H460 cells.
In the sensitive H358 cells, erlotinib also increased PP2A activity,
and CIP2A overexpression decreased PP2A activity (Fig. 2B).
Erlotinib did not change PP2A activity and CIP2A gene knockdown
by siRNA increased PP2A activity in the resistant H460 cells (Fig. 2B)
and A549 cells (Supplementary Fig. 2). These data indicate that the
CIP2A signaling pathway may play an important role in determining
the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to erlotinib. In addition, erlotinib
decreased CIP2A protein levels and induced apoptosis in H358 cells
in a time-dependent analysis (Fig. 2C).
Supplementary figure related to this article can be found, in the
online version, at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lungcan.2014.05.024.

3.3. Validation of the CIP2A–PP2A–AKT pathway

Two approaches were used to validate the role of CIP2A as a
mediator of erlotinib-induced apoptosis in the NSCLC cells. First,
ectopic expression of CIP2A in the H358 cells (CIP2A-myc in Fig. 3A,
left), which showed overexpression of CIP2A, partially protected
the cells from apoptotic cell death induced by erlotinib (Fig. 3A).
Furthermore, knockdown of gene expression of CIP2A increased
apoptosis in the H358 cells (Fig. 3A, right) and H460 cells (Fig. 3B).
These results indicate that CIP2A expression status is important in
regulating the apoptotic effect of erlotinib in NSCLC cells
Next, we analyzed the role of AKT, which is downstream from
CIP2A, in mediating the effects of erlotinib. As shown in Fig. 3C,
overexpression of AKT in the sensitive H358 cells partially protected
cells from apoptotic death induced by erlotinib. Fig. 3D
further showed that addition of okadaic acid, a known PP2A
inhibitor, significantly increased AKT phosphoryaltion and reduced
the erlotinib-induced apoptosis in the sensitive H358 cells. These
results indicate that AKT activation regulates erlotinib-induced
apoptosis in NSCLC cells.

3.4. Erlotinib downregulates transcription of CIP2A in NSCLC cells
without EGFR mutation

To examine the mechanisms by which erlotinib inhibited
CIP2A expression, we investigated whether erlotinib affected CIP2A
protein degradation. After protein translation was blocked by
cycloheximide, the rate of CIP2A degradation did not change significantly
with or without erlotinib treatment in either H358 or H460
cells (Fig. 4A). We next investigated whether erlotinib affected
CIP2A gene transcription. Our data showed that the mRNA levels
of CIP2A decreased in a time- and dose-dependent manner in H358

cells but not in H460 cells (Fig. 4B). To further explore the inhibition
of CIP2A transcription by erlotinib, H358 and CH460 cells
were transfected a luciferase reporter constructfor CIP2A promoter.
Erlotinib significantly down-regulated the activity of CIP2A promoter
inadose-dependentmanner inH358cells (Fig.4C).However,
erlotinib did not alter the luciferase activity H460 cells. Erlotinib
may inhibit CIP2A expression in the sensitive H358 cells by affecting
the transcriptional factor Elk-1 DNA binding [19] so we treated
H358 and H460 cells with 2 M
or 10 M
erlotinib for 24 h and
processed for the ChIP assays. The expression of Elk-1 was reduced
in a dose-dependent manner in the sensitive H358 cells, but not

Cell lysates were prepared for analysis of luciferase activity. Erlotinib decreased CIP2A luciferase activity in H358 cells, but not in H460 cells. Data are mean ± SD. n = 3 for
each condition. **p < 0.01, vs. no erlotinib. (D) Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of the CIP2A promoter. H358 and H460 cells were treated with 2 or 10 M

PCR with primer pair specific to CIP2A promoter (−16 to −213 bp) and RPL30 (internal control). The gel shown is representative of three independent experiments.

in the resistant H460 cells. These data suggest that erlotinib may
inhibit CIP2A expression in the sensitive H358 cells by affecting the
transcriptional regulation

3.5. Evaluation of the therapeutic effect of erlotinib on
H358-bearing mice

To determine whether or not the in vitro effects of erlotinib on
H358 cells could be reproduced in vivo, mice were implanted with
H358 xenograft. No apparent differences in body weight or toxicity
were found in any mice (Fig. 5A). Treatment with erlotinib significantly
inhibited H358 xenograft tumor growth and tumor sizes
were nearly one-fifth of those of control mice (Fig. 5B).

4. Discussion

Although NSCLC patients with EGFR-mutation respond well
to EGFR inhibitors, such as erlotinib, some NSCLC patients without
EGFR mutations also show favorable response. In the phase 3
Sequential Tarceva in Unresectable NSCLC (SATURN)trial, erlotinib,
used as second-line NSCLC maintenance therapy after first-line
chemotherapy without selection for EGFR status, showed better
progression free survival then placebo in patients without EGFR
mutation (hazard ratios 0.78, 95% CI 0.63–0.96; P = 0.0185) [7]. In
the Tarceva In Treatment of Advanced NSCLC (TITAN) study, which
explored the efficacy and tolerability of second-line erlotinib
versus chemotherapy in patients with refractory NSCLC, there was

no significant differences in efficacy between erlotinib and docetaxel
or pemetrexed in patients without EGFR mutation (hazard
ratios 0.85, 95% CI 0.59–1.22; P = 0.37) [8]. These two studies offer
strong clinical evidence that erlotinib has an anti-tumor effect
even in NSCLC patients without EGFR mutation, indicating the
presence of alternative mechanisms. Our study showed that the
CIP2A-dependent signaling pathway may be one such mechanism.
Our study revealed that erlotinib induced cell death and apoptosis
in the NSCLC H358 and H441 cells, but not in the H460 and A549
cells. The differential sensitivity to erlotinib was related to the status
of CIP2A since erlotinib inhibited mRNA and protein expression
of CIP2A in the NSCLC H358 and H441 cells but not in the NSCLC
(H322 and H460). In addition, overexpression of CIP2A in the sensitive
H358 cells partially protected the cells from apoptotic cell
death induced by erlotinib. Knockdown of CIP2A gene expression
in the resistant H460 cells increased apoptotic cell death induced
by erlotinib. The CIP2A effects were mediated by downstream activation
of PP2A and inhibition of AKT activation. Erlotinib treatment
increased PP2A activity and decreased AKT phosphorylation in the
sensitive H358 cells but not in the resistant H460 cells. Overexpression
of CIP2A in the erlotinib sensitive H358 cells increased
phosphorylated AKT and inhibited apoptosis. Knockdown of CIP2A
gene expression in the erlotinib resistant H460 cells decreased
the phosphorylated AKT and increased erlotinib-induced apoptosis,
thus changing the phenotype of the resistant H460 cells to
resemble the sensitive H358 cells. Our results, however, did not
exclude the possibility that other pathways, such as KRAS (Kirsten
rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) and TP53 (tumor protein p53),
may also be involved in determining the differential sensitivity to
erlotinib since the protective effects by altering the CIP2A status
was incomplete. This needs to be investigated in future research.
Our findings have several important clinical implications: First,
we showed that overexpression of CIP2A inhibited erlotinibinduced
cell death in the sensitive H358 cells. These results explain

the poor prognosis in patients whose lung tumors overexpresses
CIP2A [14–16]. Therefore, CIP2A status in the tumor may serve as
a useful marker for predicting the response to erlotinib. Besides
being used as a prognosis biomarker, we identified CIP2A as a
major molecular determinant of the therapeutic effect of erlotinib
in NSCLC patients without EGFR mutation. This was supported by
our in vivo data that showed erlotinib reduced H358 xenograft
tumors in mice and that altering the expression of CIP2A could
change the resistant H460 cells into a phenotype resembling the
sensitive H358 cells. These results provided further support that
CIP2A may be used as a novel anti-cancer target [9,15,18,20–28].
Liang Ma et al. demonstrated that Rabdocoetsin B can inhibit proliferation
and induce apoptosis in a variety of lung cancer cells by
down-regulation of CIP2A and inactivation of AKT pathway [15].
Importantly, the AKT pathway plays a major role in carcinogenesis
and drug resistance in NSCLC [29]. Several studies have also
shown that tumors with the activation of AKT signaling become
more aggressive and are associated with poor prognosis in patients
with NSCLC [30].
In conclusion, erlotinib induced apoptotic cell death in NSCLC
cells without EGFR mutation through a novel mechanism that was
CIP2A-dependent. The expression status of CIP2A could be a molecular
determinant of the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to erlotinib.
Development of noveltherapies targeting CIP2A would increase our
therapeutic options for patients with NSCLC.
