Abstract
The human genomic instability syndrome ataxia telangiectasia (A-T), caused by mutations in the gene encoding the DNA damage checkpoint kinase ATM, is characterized by multisystem defects including neurodegeneration, immunodeficiency and increased cancer predisposition. ATM is central to a pathway that responds to double-strand DNA breaks, whereas the related kinase ATR leads a parallel signaling cascade that is activated by replication stress. To dissect the physiological relationship between the ATM and ATR pathways, we generated mice defective for both. Because complete ATR pathway inactivation causes embryonic lethality, we weakened the ATR mechanism to different degrees by impairing HUS1, a member of the 911 complex that is required for efficient ATR signaling. Notably, simultaneous ATM and HUS1 defects caused synthetic lethality.
Atm/Hus1
double-mutant embryos showed widespread apoptosis and died mid-gestationally. Despite the underlying DNA damage checkpoint defects, increased DNA damage signaling was observed, as evidenced by H2AX phosphorylation and p53 accumulation. A less severe
Hus1
defect together with
Atm
loss resulted in partial embryonic lethality, with the surviving double-mutant mice showing synergistic increases in genomic instability and specific developmental defects, including dwarfism, craniofacial abnormalities and brachymesophalangy, phenotypes that are observed in several human genomic instability disorders. In addition to identifying tissue-specific consequences of checkpoint dysfunction, these data highlight a robust, cooperative configuration for the mammalian DNA damage response network and further suggest
HUS1
and related genes in the ATR pathway as candidate modifiers of disease severity in A-T patients.INTRODUCTION
Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T, OMIM #208900) is a hereditary genomic instability syndrome caused by loss of function mutations in
ATM
, which encodes a protein kinase involved in the cellular DNA damage response (DDR) (
1
). A-T is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasias, immunodeficiency, infertility, increased cancer incidence and radiation hypersensitivity. These clinical manifestations are the consequence of failed responses to DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) that arise spontaneously or as programmed developmental events. Rare patients with atypical manifestation of the disease have been described and referred to as ‘A-T variants’. One such variant, termed A-T
Fresno
, combines typical A-T phenotypes with microcephaly and mental retardation, making it among the most severe A-T forms known (
2
).
ATM normally functions as the main component of one of the cellular DNA damage checkpoint pathways that detect aberrant DNA structures and coordinate DNA repair with cell cycle progression. Checkpoint mechanisms are part of a broader DDR that protects genomic integrity and ensures normal development, tissue homeostasis and cancer-free survival (
3
). In response to DSB, the ATM kinase undergoes a transition from inactive dimer to active, auto-phosphorylated monomer and then phosphorylates numerous substrates involved in signaling transduction and downstream effector functions, including H2AX, CHK2 and p53. A second checkpoint pathway, organized around the related kinase ATR, responds to a wide variety of lesions, including bulky DNA adducts and DNA crosslinks, as well as processed DSB. Activated ATR phosphorylates CHK1 and other targets, promoting fork stabilization, inhibition of late origin firing and stimulation of DNA repair (
4
). Critical for ATR activation is the RAD9–RAD1–HUS1 (911) complex, a PCNA-like clamp that is loaded onto damage sites and recruits the ATR activator TOPBP1 (
5
). Importantly, the 911 complex additionally has direct roles in regulating base excision repair, translesion DNA synthesis and apoptotic signaling (
6
). The genes encoding the 911 complex, like all ATR pathway core components, are essential for organismal survival (
7
–
9
). Partial
ATR
impairment in humans leads to Seckel syndrome (SCKL1, OMIM #210600), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by proportional dwarfism, microcephaly, craniofacial abnormalities and mental retardation (
10
).
Owing to their distinct componentry and activation by different types of genome damage, the ATM and ATR pathways initially were thought to function as independent, separable mechanisms. However, aberrant DNA structures often engage both pathways to some extent, and there is substantial biochemical crosstalk between the pathways (
4
). A full appreciation of these interactions in vertebrates has been hampered by a lack of suitable genetic tools. Although
Atm
-deficient mice are viable and show many A-T phenotypes (
11
–
13
), the severe phenotypes associated with ATR pathway impairment have been an impediment to understanding the biological significance of the interplay between the ATM and ATR pathways. In this study, we overcome this limitation with an
Hus1
allelic series in which null (
Hus1
Δ
1n
) or wild-type (
Hus1
+
) alleles are used in combination with a hypomorphic (
Hus1
neo
) allele that expresses
Hus1
at ∼40% of the wild-type level (
14
).
Hus1
neo/
Δ
1n
mice, which have the lowest
Hus1
expression in the series, are born at expected frequencies and appear grossly normal but are incapable of proper genome maintenance as evidenced by increased spontaneous GIN and hypersensitivity to exogenous genotoxins (
14
). By combining the
Hus1
allelic series with targeted
Atm
deletion, we identify an essential cooperative relationship between ATM and HUS1 during embryonic development and in specific adult tissues.RESULTS
Combined inactivation of
Atm
and
Hus1
results in synthetic lethality
To elucidate the genetic relationships between the ATM- and ATR-mediated DNA damage checkpoint pathways, we generated mice defective for both. Interbreeding of mice bearing targeted
Atm
and
Hus1
alleles was performed in order to produce
Atm
-deficient mice with incremental reductions in
Hus1
gene dosage (
Hus1
+/+
>
Hus1
+/neo
>
Hus1
+/Δ1n
>
Hus1
neo/neo
>
Hus1
neo/Δ1n
).
Hus1
+/neo
cells and mice are phenotypically normal and frequently used as wild-type equivalents in this study (
14
). Of the 1753 weaned offspring analyzed, no
Hus1
neo/Δ1n
Atm
−/−
mice were obtained, and only 84
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
mice were obtained, although 259 were expected (Table
1
;
P
<0.001,
χ
2
test). The nature of the lethal phenotype associated with combined
Atm
and
Hus1
inactivation was determined by analyzing double-mutant and control embryos from embryonic day E8.5 to birth (
Supplementary Material, Table S1
). Although
Hus1
neo/Δ1n
Atm
−/−
embryos appeared normal at E8.5, they were smaller relative to their littermates at E9.5 and all died between E10.5 and E11.5 (Fig.
1
A–D). A less severe
Hus1
defect in
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
embryos resulted in no gross abnormalities prior to E13.5, at which point the double-mutant embryos were smaller than their littermates. Approximately 30% of
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
embryos were abnormal at E14.5 and died by E15.5 (Fig.
1
E–H).
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
mice that survived beyond this mid-gestational period were significantly smaller than control littermates (Fig.
3
A and B;
P
<0.05, Student's
t
-test), and 30–40% of mice of this genotype died on the first day of life (P1) (
Supplementary Material, Table S1
), whereas the remainder survived beyond weaning (Table
1
). Together, these data indicate that although defects in
Atm
or
Hus1
individually are compatible with grossly normal development and organismal viability, simultaneous defects in
Atm
and
Hus1
cause synthetic lethality in an
Hus1
gene dosage dependent manner.

Increased genomic instability and cell death in
Atm/Hus1
-deficient embryos
The failure of cells to deal with replication stress and spontaneous DNA lesions can lead to impaired cell proliferation and/or survival (
15
). To evaluate these outcomes in
Atm/Hus1
mutant embryos, we initially performed Feulgen–Schiff staining on E10.5 embryos and quantified the frequency of pyknotic and mitotic nuclei. There was a significant increase in pyknotic nuclei, indicative of apoptosis in
Hus1
neo/
Δ
1n
Atm
−/−
and
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
embryos when compared with the
Hus1
+/neo
Atm
+/+
control group (
Supplementary Material, Fig. S1
;
P
<0.001, Student's
t
-test). By contrast, cell proliferation was unaffected. We reasoned that the apparent increase in apoptosis in the
Atm/Hus1
double-mutants could be due to checkpoint activation and therefore monitored the accumulation of phosphorylated H2AX (γ-H2AX;
Supplementary Material, Fig. S1D
) and total p53, markers of an activated DDR (
3
). Terminal uridine deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining also was performed to directly measure apoptosis. Although almost no γ-H2AX, p53 or TUNEL-positive cells were detected in
Atm
or
Hus1
single-mutant embryos,
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
and, to an even greater extent,
Hus1
neo/
Δ
1n
Atm
−/−
littermates showed significantly increased positive staining (Fig.
2
A and B;
P
<0.05, Student's
t
-test). Because p53 can induce cell cycle arrest through transcriptional activation of
p21
or apoptosis by upregulating
Bax
and
Puma
, we used real-time PCR to measure the expression level of these genes in E10.5 embryos. Consistent with the observation of p53 accumulation in
Atm/Hus1
double-mutant embryos, there was a corresponding significant increase in
p21
expression (Fig.
2
C;
P
<0.05, Student's
t
-test). Interestingly, there were no detectable changes in
Bax
or
Puma
expression, raising the possibility of a p53-independent apoptotic mechanism. Similar results were observed by northern blot analysis (data not shown). Altogether, these findings suggest that the embryonic lethality following combined deregulation of
Atm
and
Hus1
is associated with a generalized accumulation of genome damage, activation of a DDR and ultimately widespread apoptosis.

Dwarfism in adult
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
mice
Approximately one-third of
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
mice survived to adulthood, and without exception these animals exhibited a striking dwarfism that became apparent at approximately E13.5 and persisted through adulthood (Fig.
3
A–D). Consistent with previous reports (
11
–
13
), modestly reduced body size was observed in
Hus1
+/neo
Atm
−/−
mice defective for
Atm
alone. This phenotype was significantly enhanced in
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
animals, which on average were 40% smaller by weight than control littermates at 6 weeks of age (Fig.
3
D;
P
<0.01, mixed model analysis). Most organs were proportionally smaller in both
Hus1
+/neo
Atm
−/−
and
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
mice when compared with
Hus1
+/neo
Atm
+/+
controls (
Supplementary Material, Table S2
).
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
mice showed a slight increase in relative brain size when compared with mice of all other genotypes, but this was not associated with any apparent histopathological abnormalities (
Supplementary Material, Fig. S2
).
It is well established that the somatotroph axis that includes growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) plays important roles in somatic growth and aging (
16
). Deficiencies in the GH/IGF1 somatotroph axis are observed in some mouse mutants that display dwarfism in conjunction with underlying DDR defects (
17
). In order to understand the molecular basis for the dwarfism in
Atm/Hus1
mutant mice, we analyzed the expression levels of
Igf1
and
Ghr
and found no difference in their transcript levels in livers of 6-week-old mice of representative genotypes (Fig.
3
E), findings that were confirmed by qPCR (data not shown). Furthermore, preliminary analyses revealed no differences in circulating IGF1 levels in
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
mice relative to controls (data not shown). Overall, these results demonstrate that combined
Atm
and
Hus1
deficiency has a severe impact on body size from mid-gestation to adulthood and that this proportional dwarfism arises independently of detectable abnormalities in the somatotroph axis.
Skeletal abnormalities in
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
mice
Visual inspection of
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
mice also revealed fronto-parietal alopecia and an abnormal facial morphology (Fig.
3
C). To understand the origins of these abnormalities, we performed Alizarin red/Alcian blue staining of embryos. At E18.5,
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
embryos had widely open sagittal (midline) sutures and presented an array of fenestrations primarily in the parietal bone (Fig.
4
A) that were also apparent as early as E15.5 (
Supplementary Material, Fig. S3A
). In order to characterize the craniofacial defects in adult animals, we first produced isolated skull preparations from mice at 6 weeks of age. Grossly,
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
skulls showed a domed morphology with an incomplete closure of the sagittal sutures and reduced bone thickness in the fronto-parietal region, and multiple fenestrations in the parietal bone and jagged coronal (fronto-parietal) sutures (Fig.
4
B and C). To identify and quantify patterns in skull morphology, we analyzed high-resolution three-dimensional images generated by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) (
Supplementary Material, Fig. S3D
). A series of measurements were then subjected to principal component (PC) analysis to identify suites of changes in skull morphology. The first PC explained 83.6% of the total variation in the 23 skull measurements. Therefore, in a single value PC1 quantified the great majority of the skeletal variation between
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
samples and those of
Hus1
+/neo
Atm
+/+
,
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
+/+
and
Hus1
+/neo
Atm
−/−
genotypes (
Supplementary Material, Fig. S3E
). The correlations or factor loadings between the PC1 score and each distance measured for each mouse further resolved the pattern of variation: the skulls of
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
mice were smaller overall and differed in shape, with an elongated inter-parietal bone and a wider frontal bone, which increased the inter-orbital distance (
Supplementary Material, Fig. S3F
).

−/−
mice, and the bar graphs of the corresponding measurement data (
n

Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
mice when compared with all other genotypes (*
P
< 0.001, Student's
t
-test).
Detailed analysis of the embryonic skeletal preparations also revealed brachymesophalangy of the fifth digit (
Supplementary Material, Fig. S3B and C
). Interestingly, this and the related phenotype of clinodactyly are associated with several hereditary GIN syndromes, other congenital disorders and fetal teratogen exposure (
18
). Further inspection of micro-CT images indicated that the phalangeal defect was fully penetrant in adult
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
mice and affected both the forelimbs and hindlimbs (Fig.
4
D and E). Quantitative measurements showed that the mesophalanx of the fifth digit was less than one-half of the expected size in
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
mice relative to controls, whereas the remaining digits were unaffected (
P
<0.001, Student's
t
-test). Considered together with the craniofacial defects described above, these results demonstrate an essential dual function for
Atm
and
Hus1
in the development of the skeleton and suggest a potential elevated sensitivity of particular bone progenitor cells to checkpoint impairment and genomic instability.
Increased genomic instability in adult mice defective for both
Atm
and
Hus1
HUS1 and ATM are integral components of DNA damage signaling pathways that function to protect genomic integrity. We therefore tested the impact of combined
Atm
and
Hus1
defects on GIN in adult mice by measuring micronucleus (MN) formation in peripheral blood cells, using a flow cytometry-based assay. MN are entire chromosomes or fragments of chromosomes that have not been incorporated in the main nuclei at cell division and are a hallmark of GIN. Consistent with previous findings (
14
,
19
), a moderate
Hus1
defect alone in
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
+/+
mice caused no significant change in MN formation relative to
Hus1
+/neo
Atm
+/+
littermate controls, whereas
Atm
deficiency alone was associated with significantly increased MN formation in
Hus1
+/neo
Atm
−/−
mice (Fig.
5
A;
P
<0.001, Student's
t
-test). Notably,
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
mice had more than an additive increase in MN formation when compared with
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
+/+
and
Hus1
+/neo
Atm
−/−
animals (
P
=0.002, univariate analysis of variance). In contrast, expression of damage-inducible genes such as
p21
was unaltered in the adult liver, a relatively quiescent tissue (
Supplementary Material, Fig. S4
). These observations suggest that phenotypes associated with combined
Atm
and
Hus1
defects in adult mice may be more pronounced in proliferating cell populations such as blood cell precursors and highlight a potential role for replication stress as a key factor in the observed genetic interaction.

(

(

P

Increased GIN may influence different steps
en route
to carcinogenesis, including tumor initiation and progression, and in
Atm
-null mice contributes to the development of thymic lymphoma with near-complete penetrance (
11
–
13
). Prior to tumor development,
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
and
Hus1
+/neo
Atm
−/−
mice contained similar numbers of lymphocytes in the thymus (Fig.
5
B) and circulating blood (
Supplementary Material, Table S3
) and subsequently showed no significant difference in tumor-free survival as determined by Kaplan–Meier survival analysis (Fig.
5
D). Furthermore, the resulting neoplasms were indistinguishable histopathologically (Fig.
5
C). Together, these results reveal that combined defects in
Atm
and
Hus1
result in synergistic increases in GIN in adult mice but without major consequences on thymic tumorigenesis.
Partial
Hus1
impairment synergizes with
Atm
deficiency to accelerate senescence without detectably altering key DNA damage checkpoint signaling events or radiation sensitivity
The strong genetic interaction observed between
Atm
and
Hus1
raised the possibility of overlapping roles for these checkpoint proteins in DNA damage signaling. Complete
Hus1
inactivation results in impaired activation of the ATR substrate CHK1 but does not diminish the induction of the ATM substrates CHK2 or p53 (
20
). Consistent with the prevailing view that ATM activation occurs independently of the 911 complex, we observed that IR- or UV-induced ATM phosphorylation occurred to a similar or greater extent in
Hus1
-null cells when compared with
Hus1
-proficient controls (Fig.
6
A). To better understand the relationship between
Atm
and
Hus1
at the cell and molecular levels, we isolated primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from the
Atm/Hus1
mouse model and analyzed their behavior in culture. Metaphase chromosome analysis of the MEF cultures at passage 1 revealed an increased frequency of chromosomal abnormalities in
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
double-mutant cells when compared with
Atm
or
Hus1
single mutants (
Supplementary Material, Fig. S5
). In particular,
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
cells exhibited a significant increase in the occurrence of extensive chromosomal damage (
P
<0.02, Student's
t
-test) as well as an increased frequency of radial figures (
P
<0.03, Student's
t
-test) when compared with cells of all other genotypes analyzed.

Consistent with previous results (

,

),
Atm
-deficient
Hus1
+/neo
Atm
−/−
MEFs underwent senescence prematurely, whereas
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
+/+
MEFs doubled in a manner similar to
Hus1
+/neo
Atm
+/+
control cells. The combination of
Atm
and
Hus1
defects in
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
MEFs resulted in extremely rapid senescence after just a few doublings (
Supplementary Material, Fig. S6A
). Nevertheless, cells of all genotypes were capable of undergoing spontaneous immortalization, after which they doubled at similar rates when maintained under standard 3T3 culture conditions, both in low (3%) (data not shown) and normal (20%) O
2
levels (
Supplementary Material, Fig. S6A
). The proliferative capacity of the spontaneously immortalized
Atm/Hus1
MEFs was analyzed under more stringent conditions by plating cells at low density and assessing the colony-forming potential of each cell line. Colony formation was reduced in immortalized
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
+/+
cells and impaired to an even greater degree in
Hus1
+/neo
Atm
−/−
MEFs. Remarkably,
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
MEFs were completely defective for colony formation, under either atmospheric (
Supplementary Material, Fig. S6B
) or low-oxygen conditions (data not shown), despite the fact that these cells showed normal proliferation when cultured at higher densities. Thus, simultaneous defects in
Atm
and
Hus1
result in accelerated senescence and, despite being compatible with spontaneous immortalization, cause profound impairment of the capacity of single cells to grow out as colonies.
To further understand the cooperative relationship between ATM and HUS1 in DNA damage signaling, we next treated the
Atm/Hus1
primary MEFs with UV or IR and assessed the activation of canonical ATM and ATR downstream targets. Untreated
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
MEFs had slightly higher basal levels of p53 and phospho-CHK1 (Fig.
6
B), suggestive of increased spontaneous DNA damage accumulation. Moderate
Hus1
impairment alone had no detectable effect on DNA damage signaling upon IR treatment, with comparable levels of CHK2 phosphorylation and p53 accumulation occurring in
Hus1
+/neo
Atm
+/+
and
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
+/+
cells. The slight accumulation of phosphorylated CHK1 following IR also was unchanged in
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
+/+
cells. Lacking ATM alone,
Hus1
+/neo
Atm
−/−
cells showed delayed induction of both CHK2 and p53 following IR and a slight increase in CHK1 phosphorylation. Interestingly,
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
MEFs showed the same IR-induced DDR kinetics as
Hus1
+/neo
Atm
−/−
cells, and the magnitude of the response was similar with the exception that CHK1 activation after IR was even greater in cells defective for both
Atm
and
Hus1
. In response to UV, CHK2 and CHK1 phosphorylation as well as p53 accumulation were unaffected by
Atm
inactivation, partial
Hus1
impairment, or both (Fig.
6
B). Although defects in other signaling events not analyzed here cannot be ruled out, these data suggest that primary
Atm/Hus1
double-mutant cells can trigger key DNA damage checkpoint signaling events as well as the single mutants. As a final measure of how interactions between
Atm
and
Hus1
affect the DDR, we compared the radiation sensitivity of mice with individual or combined defects in
Atm
and
Hus1
. Consistent with the lack of detectable synergistic effects on IR-induced checkpoint signaling in MEFs,
Atm/Hus1
double-mutant mice showed an equivalent sensitivity to whole-body IR exposure as
Atm
single-mutant mice, which are hypersensitive to IR (Fig.
6
C). Thus, the defective DSB response in
Atm
-deficient mice is not substantially worsened by additional partial
Hus1
impairment.DISCUSSION
The ATM and ATR DNA damage checkpoint pathways were initially viewed as separable, parallel signaling cascades that respond to distinct DNA lesions. However, recent biochemical evidence indicating significant crosstalk between the two pathways has led to the concept of a broad, integrated DDR network (
22
). Nevertheless, the genetic relationship between these pathways in vertebrates has been difficult to investigate due to the lethality associated with a complete inactivation of ATR pathway components. Here we used a system for partial
Hus1
inactivation to show for the first time that ATM and HUS1 cooperate in genome maintenance
in vivo.
Whereas mice defective for either
Atm
or
Hus1
alone are viable, simultaneous dysfunction of both genes resulted in synthetic lethality. The ability to fine-tune
Hus1
expression levels further revealed tissue-specific phenotypes, such as craniofacial and limb defects, associated with moderate
Hus1
impairment in an
Atm
-deficient background. This was unexpected, as the two main mammalian DDR pathways are often considered ubiquitously important, and suggests that there is significant tissue-specific variation in the level of endogenous DNA damage and/or the activity of additional pathways that respond to DNA lesions. Mapping out these specificities will be critical for understanding the etiology of many inborn diseases as well as the nature of organismal responses to chemotherapeutics and other genotoxic agents.
The most striking phenotype in
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
−/−
mice was their significantly reduced overall size, which was apparent prior to birth. In mice and humans, there are several reports of dwarfism associated with DDR defects, but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood in many cases. Most theories on how DDR dysfunction causes dwarfism center on either cell-autonomous defects or systemic growth axis perturbations. In particular, the impairment of nucleotide excision repair in mouse models of Cockayne syndrome results in dwarfism, which is associated with the suppression of the GH/IGF1 axis in what is believed to represent a homeostatic feedback response to GIN (
17
). Likewise, SIRT6 deficiency in mice results in genomic instability, reduced
Gh/Igf1
expression and dwarfism (
23
). Conversely, other mouse models in which inactivation of genome maintenance mechanisms leads to dwarfism maintain an intact somatotroph axis. For instance,
Atm
-null mice are slightly smaller than their littermates (
11
–
13
) but show no differences in the circulating levels of GH or free IGF1 (
24
). Similarly, mice lacking KU80, a subunit of the DNA–PK complex, are smaller than their littermates but have an intact somatotroph axis (
25
,
26
).
Notably, proportional dwarfism is a characteristic of humans with Seckel syndrome. Clinical reports indicate that the GH/IGF1 axis is normal in Seckel patients, although an
Atr
-Seckel mouse model shows reduced
Igf1
and
Ghr
expression (
27
,
28
). Interestingly, Seckel syndrome also can be caused by mutations in genes encoding centrosomal proteins, including
PCNT
,
CEP152
and
CENPJ
(
29
–
32
). In these cases, defective cell division has been hypothesized to drive the cell loss that underlies the reduced body size. The apparently normal GH/IGF1 axis in
Atm/Hus1
mice suggests that a cell-autonomous defect also might be responsible for the proportional dwarfism reported here and raises the possibility that DNA damage accumulation upon combined
Atm
and
Hus1
impairment leads to small size through defective expansion of key cell populations, either throughout the body or in specific compartments that impact body size, such as stem cell pools or developing bone growth plates (
33
,
34
).
In addition to their small size,
Atm/Hus1
double-mutant animals showed skeletal abnormalities that included incomplete ossification and aberrant architecture of the skull, as well as significant shortening of the mesophalanx of the fifth digit (brachymesophalangy V) in both forelimbs and hindlimbs. Craniofacial defects are common in patients suffering from GIN-related disorders, including Seckel syndrome (
35
), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (due to
NBS1
mutations) (
36
) and Williams–Beuren syndrome (caused by a micro-deletion at 7q11.23 that includes
RFC2
) (
37
). Digit abnormalities, including brachymesophalangy and clinodactyly, are frequently observed in patients with Seckel syndrome as well as another GIN disorder, Fanconi anemia (
38
). In addition to their association with hereditary disease, craniofacial defects and brachymesophalangy V also are present following fetal exposure to teratogens, such as alcohol (
39
), and may be hallmarks of excessive DNA damage during development (
40
). Why GIN is frequently associated with these particular developmental phenotypes is largely unknown, but may reflect a heightened stress sensitivity in certain cell types. Such a mechanism has been identified in Treacher Collins syndrome, in which the occurrence of craniofacial abnormalities has been attributed to a lower threshold of neural crest cells for stress-induced p53-dependent apoptosis (
41
). In
Atm/Hus1
mice, cell death triggered by increased genomic instability could potentially impact crest-derived cells required for suture maintenance, possibly explaining the retarded dorsal expansion of these roofing bones. The lateral fenestrations in
Atm/Hus1
skull bones beginning at the initial stages of bone formation suggest that early ossification is disrupted, but do not provide clues as to why these specific sites are affected. The mouse model described here will be a powerful tool for understanding cell-type-specific responses to GIN and their roles in the developmental defects observed in patients with instability syndromes.
Increased GIN in
Atm/Hus1
double-mutant mice was readily apparent during embryogenesis as well as in a tissue-specific pattern in adults, as evidenced by increased MN formation in hematopoietic cells without detectable upregulation of DNA damage-responsive genes in the liver. HUS1 loss causes chromosomal instability specifically during S-phase (
42
), and the observations reported here are consistent with a model in which the phenotypes associated with combined
Atm
and
Hus1
defects are due primarily to the failure of actively dividing cells to deal with replication stress. Surprisingly, the elevated GIN in
Atm/Hus1
mice did not significantly change the onset or histological characteristics of thymic lymphomas relative to those arising in mice lacking
Atm
alone. It may be that the rapid onset of lymphomas in
Atm
-null mice obscures effects associated with partial
Hus1
impairment. Alternatively, a greater level of genomic instability in
Atm/Hus1
double-mutant mice may have opposing consequences that neutralize each other, both fueling the accumulation of cancer-promoting mutations and interfering with the ability of cancer cells to withstand stress-associated malignant transformation. Finally, the absence of a difference in tumor-free survival may reflect a limited requirement for
Hus1
in this compartment. Previous studies have shown that thymocytes rely more on ATM and DNA-PK than on ATR (
43
), and our own work suggests that lymphocytes can tolerate
Hus1
loss better than other cell types (
44
–
46
).
Unexpectedly, although we deregulated the two primary DNA damage checkpoint pathways in the
Atm/Hus1
mouse model and observed clear phenotypic consequences, we detected only limited alterations in canonical ATM/ATR-mediated DNA damage signaling events when compared with those in
Atm
mutants alone. Indeed, for some of the factors analyzed, DNA damage signaling was increased in
Atm/Hus1
embryos and MEFs. There are several possible explanations for these observations. First, upon deregulation of the ATM and ATR pathways, an overlapping DDR kinase could become activated. Among the several possible factors that could serve such a role, the best candidate may be the PIKK DNA-PK, which is known to cooperate with ATM and ATR in H2AX phosphorylation and is capable of phosphorylating an array of DDR proteins
in vitro
, including CHK2 and p53 (
47
). However, CHK1 activation was readily apparent in
Atm/Hus1
double-mutants and there is limited evidence that DNA-PK phosphorylates CHK1 (
48
). Alternatively, ATR could mediate the checkpoint signaling either in a 911 independent manner (
49
) or via residual HUS1 expression from the hypomorphic
Hus1
allele. Although
Atm/Hus1
-defective cells can sense and mount signaling responses to DNA damage, this response is clearly ineffective, resulting in GIN, followed by massive apoptosis and embryonic lethality. The observed accumulation of genome damage could be due to a repair defect, an elevated damage load that overwhelms the repair machinery, or both.
Hus1
impairment did not further worsen the radiation sensitivity of
Atm
-null mice, indicating that the synthetic phenotypes in
Hus1/Atm
double-mutant mice are unlikely to originate from more severe DSB response defects relative to those in
Atm
single-mutants. Given that the 911 complex has been directly implicated in several DNA repair processes, including base excision repair and translesion synthesis, we favor the model that defective DNA repair following HUS1 deregulation leads to an increased number of DNA lesions that are normally resolved efficiently in an ATM-dependent manner, resulting in the observed synthetic lethality when both pathways are defective simultaneously (
Supplementary Material, Fig. S7
).
The strong genetic interaction between
Atm
and
Hus1
in mice also has implications for human disease. First, the synergistic increases in genome damage and apoptosis observed here following combined
Atm
and
Hus1
impairment suggest that therapeutic targeting of HUS1 or the broader ATR pathway may be effective for some malignancies that arise due to ATM pathway mutations, which may be as many as 70% of all cancers (
50
,
51
). However, the efficacy of such a strategy may depend on the cell of origin or other factors like the particular initiating oncogenic events in the tumor, as the impact of simultaneous
Atm
and
Hus1
defects varied between tissues. Another implication of this work relates to the basis for variant forms of A-T, like A-T
Fresno
, which is associated with
ATM
mutations but combines typical A-T phenotypes with microcephaly and mental retardation (
2
). This variation has been attributed to genetic modifiers outside of
ATM
. The findings presented here suggest that polymorphisms in
HUS1
or other ATR pathway genes could significantly impact the onset and severity of A-T phenotypes.MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
All animals used in this study were handled in accordance with federal and institutional guidelines, under a protocol approved by the Cornell University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Hus1
neo
and
Hus1
Δ1n
mice were maintained on the 129S6 background (
7
,
14
).
Atm
knockout mice were maintained on the FVB background (
12
). These strains were interbred to create
Atm/Hus1
double-mutant mice. Mice were genotyped by PCR analysis of genomic DNA isolated from tail snip biopsies as previously described (
7
). Images of live mice and skulls were taken using a Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi digital camera equipped with a Canon EF-S 18–55 mm lens. For analysis of embryonic development, timed matings were performed. Noon of the day of vaginal plug detection was defined as embryonic day E0.5. For analysis of tumor-free survival, a cohort of mice was maintained for up to 18 months of age or until the appearance of visible neoplasms or signs of clinical disease, including weight loss, hunched posture, labored breathing, poor grooming or wasting, at which point they were euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation and necropsied. For analysis of radiation sensitivity, mice were subjected to 4 or 5 Gy doses of γ-irradiation, using a Mark I Model 68 sealed
137
Cs source gamma irradiator (JL Shepherd & Associates), and monitored for up to 30 days or until reaching humane endpoint criteria based on the clinical disease signs noted above.
Histology and immunohistochemistry
Following euthanasia, isolated tissues were weighed and then fixed in 10% formalin. Embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Histological sections of paraffin-embedded tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and subjected to pathological assessment. For the assessment of nuclear morphology, Feulgen–Schiff staining was carried out using a standard protocol (
7
). For immunohistochemistry, E10.5 embryos were embedded in paraffin, and serial 5 μm sections were collected on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher) and processed for immunohistochemistry using citric acid for p53 or EDTA for γ-H2AX-based antigen retrieval. Sections were incubated with anti-γ-H2AX (Upstate #05-636) or p53 (Cell Signaling #2524) antibodies, followed by a secondary biotinylated anti-mouse antibody (Invitrogen, Histostain SP 95-6543B). DAB (DAKO) was used as a chromogen, and hematoxylin as a counter-stain. TUNEL staining was performed using the Apoptag (Chemicon International) system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantification was done by counting the frequency of DAB-positive cells as depicted in
Supplementary Material, Figure S1D
. More than 1000 cells from at least three 100× fields were counted per embryo. Histology images were obtained using an Aperio Scanscope (Aperio Technologies, USA).
Skeletal morphology and measurements
Micro-CT scans were done on both living mice and isolated specimens, using GE CT120 micro-CT (GE Healthcare, London, Ontario, Canada) and Xradia VersaXRM-500 (Xradia, Pleasanton, CA, USA) scanners. Standard micro-CT scan parameters were used and are available upon request. For isolated skull preparations, mice were euthanized and decapitated, and heads were de-skinned and boiled in tap water for 20 min. Skulls were then mechanically cleaned using forceps, whereas the brain was removed by flushing with water. Skulls were dried before being stored. For live imaging, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and scanned. In order to accurately measure the distance between two points of interest, we developed a tool for marking points on the skull surface in three-dimensional (3D) image space. For every marked point, a surface coordinate location was computed in millimeters for
x
,
y
and
z
3-D coordinates. The distance between any two surface points was computed using the Euclidean distance of the mapped image coordinates. Statistical analysis of the resulting morphometry data was performed by a PC analysis using the princomp() function and a covariance matrix in R 2.6.0. Limbs were isolated after euthanasia and subjected to micro-CT imaging as described above. Analysis of the resulting data and 3D reconstructions were done using the OsiriX software (
52
). Skeletal staining with Alcian blue and Alizarin red was performed as previously described (
53
). Briefly, embryos were eviscerated, fixed in 80% ethanol for at least 24 h, dehydrated in 95% ethanol and stained overnight with Alcian blue (Sigma A3157) in 95% ethanol:1% glacial acetic acid solution. The bone was counterstained with Alizarin red (Sigma A5533) in 2% KOH for 3 h. Embryos were cleared in a decreasing 2% KOH/glycerol series (80:20; 60:40; 40:60) for 24 h each and stored indefinitely in 2% KOH:glycerol (20:80). The stained embryos were imaged using a Leica MZ125 inverse microscope equipped with an RT slider camera (Diagnostic Instruments).
MN assay
Analysis of MN formation in peripheral blood cells was performed as previously described (
14
,
19
). Briefly, peripheral blood was collected from the mandibular vein, fixed in methanol and incubated in bicarbonate buffer containing RNase A and anti-CD71: FITC antibody (Biodesign International). After washing and staining with propidium iodide, the cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA).
Cell culture and proliferation measurements
MEFs were prepared from E13.5 embryos, following timed matings between
Hus1
+/neo
Atm
+/−
and
Hus1
neo/neo
Atm
+/−
mice. Briefly, embryos were dissected from the deciduum, mechanically disrupted and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1.0 m
m
l
-glutamine, 0.1 m
m
minimal essential medium nonessential amino acids, 100 µg/ml streptomycin sulfate and 100 U/ml penicillin. The initial plating was defined as passage zero (p0), and cells were subsequently maintained on a 3T3 protocol (
54
). Clonogenic potential was assessed by plating MEFs in six-well dishes at 5 × 10
2
or 3 × 10
3
cells per well and changing the media every 3 days. After 11 days in culture, cells were washed with PBS and fixed in methanol for 1 h at room temperature, stained overnight with a 5% crystal violet solution in 70% ethanol and washed with tap water. Immortalized
Hus1
+/+
p21
−/−
and
Hus1

p21
−/−
MEFs were described previously (
7
). For IR treatment, cells at passage 2 or 3 were exposed to γ-irradiation, using a Mark I Model 68 sealed
137
Cs source gamma irradiator (JL Shepherd & Associates), at a dose rate of 123.1 rad/min. For UV treatment, the medium was removed from the cells, cells were washed with PBS, the top of the culture dish was removed and the cells were exposed to 254 nm UV light, using a XL-1000 UV Crosslinker (Spectro Linker).
Northern blotting and real-time PCR
Total RNA was prepared from E10.5 embryos and from the liver, using RNA STAT-60 reagent (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX, USA), and then resolved on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with
32
P-labeled cDNA probes. Quantification of signal intensity was done using a Storm 860 phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Total RNA was used for reverse transcription, using the SuperScript III kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR) was performed on an ABI 7500 System (PE Applied-Biosystems) using cDNA as a template in the presence of SYBR-green (Quanta Biosciences PerfeCTa SYBR Green FastMix). Primer pairs were designed using the Integrated DNA Technologies' RealTime PCR Assay Design Tool (
www.idtdna.com
) to generate intron-spanning products of 150–200 bp as follows:
Ghr
: 5′-AGCCTCGATTCACCA AGTG-3′ and 5′-AATTCTTGCAGCTTGTCGTTG-3′;
Igf1
: 5′-GAGACTGGAGATGTACTGTGC-3′ and 5′-CTCCTTTG CAGCTTCGTTTTC-3′;
Gstt2
: 5′-TGCCCAAGTCCACGAA TAC-3′ and 5′-CCAGGACCATTCTATCTCTGTTC-3′;
Bax
: 5′-TTGGAGATGAACTGGACAGC-3′ and 5′-CAGTTGAAG TTGCCATCAGC-3′;
Puma
: 5′-CTGGAGGGTCATGTACA ATCTC-3′ and 5′-GGTGTCAGAAGGCGGAG-3′;
p21
: 5′-C TTGCACTCTGGTGTCTGAG-3′ and 5′-GCACTTCAGGGT TTTCTCTTG-3′;
beta-actin
: 5′-ACCTTCTACAATGAGCT GCG-3′ and 5′-CTGGATGGCTACGTACATGG-3′. The generation of specific PCR products was confirmed by melting curve analysis and gel electrophoresis. Each primer pair was tested with a logarithmic dilution of cDNA mix to generate a linear standard curve, which was used to calculate the primer pair efficiency (
55
).
Western blotting
Cells were harvested and solubilized in RIPA buffer as described previously (
56
), or protein was extracted using a high-salt extraction procedure (
57
). Total protein was quantified by the Bradford assay, resolved on 6–14% SDS–PAGE gels and subjected to immunoblotting using antibodies from Millipore (anti-γ-H2AX, #05-636 and anti-CHK2, #05-649), Santa Cruz (anti-CHK1, G-4; sc-8408 and anti-p53, FL-393; sc-6243), Cell Signaling (anti-phospho-CHK1, Ser345, #2341), Rockland (anti-ATM, pSer1981, 200-310-400) and Sigma (anti-beta actin, #A5441). Western blot imaging and quantification were performed using a Versa Doc Imaging System (Bio-Rad Laboratories).SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL
