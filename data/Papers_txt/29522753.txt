ABSTRACT

PTEN deficiency often causes defects in DNA damage repair. Currently, effective therapies for breast cancer are
lacking. ATM is an attractive target for cancer treatment. Previous studies suggested a synthetic lethality between
PTEN and PARP. However, the synthetically lethal interaction between PTEN and ATM in breast cancer
has not been reported. Moreover, the mechanism remains elusive. Here, using KU-60019, an ATM kinase inhibitor,
we investigated ATM inhibition as a synthetically lethal strategy to target breast cancer cells with PTEN
defects. We found that KU-60019 preferentially sensitizes PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells to
cisplatin, though it also slightly enhances sensitivity of PTEN wild-type breast cancer cells. The increased cytotoxic
sensitivity is associated with apoptosis, as evidenced by flow cytometry and PARP cleavage. Additionally,
the increase of DNA damage accumulation due to the decreased capability of DNA repair, as indicated by γH2AX
and Rad51 foci, also contributed to this selective cytotoxicity. Mechanistically, compared with PTEN wildtype
MDA-MB-231 cells, PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 cells have lower level of Rad51, higher ATM kinase activity,
and display the elevated level of DNA damage. Moreover, these differences could be further enlarged by
cisplatin. Our findings suggest that ATM is a promising target for PTEN-defective breast cancer.

1. Introduction

Breast cancer is one of the most malignant gynecologic cancers, and
often causes injury to women worldwide [1–3]. Breast cancer is a
highly heterogeneous disease [4], and many breast cancer subtypes
have been identified based on their morphological features, response to
treatment, and clinical outcome [2,4]. The most common breast cancer
subtype is hormone receptor-positive (HR+) disease [5], which constitutes
75% of all breast cancers [6]. Triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC) is another breast cancer subtype with high rate of tumor recurrence
and metastasis, which is characterized by lack of estrogen
receptor, progesterone receptor and Her-2 receptor [2,4,7]. The major
cause of metastasis and recurrence in TNBC may be due to lack of

molecular targets for targeted therapy [2]. Therefore, identification of
some important molecular targets and development of the corresponding
small molecular inhibitors is of significance for treating breast
cancer.
PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 10q23
[2,8]. Loss of PTEN is a frequent event in breast cancer. Notably, PTEN
loss in triple-negative breast cancer is higher than other breast cancer
subgroups [2,9,10]. Furthermore, Loss of PTEN is associated with aggressive
behavior and poor prognosis [2,11]. PTEN is a lipid phosphatase
with a canonical role in inhibiting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K)-AKT pathway. Recent reports have shown that PTEN has a
new nuclear function, including transcriptional regulation of the
RAD51 gene, whose product is essential for homologous recombination

T
(HR) repair of DNA breaks [12], and regulation of cell cycle checkpoints
[13], suggesting that PTEN plays an important role in regulating
DNA damage repair during the DNA damage response (DDR).
The DNA damage response (DDR) is essential to maintain genomic
stability in the face of ongoing insult from environmental and endogenous
DNA damage [14,15]. The DDR transduces DNA damage
signals for DNA repair and to cell cycle checkpoints that stalled cell
progress until DNA repair is completed [15]. During the DNA damage
response, PI3-Kinase related kinases (PIKKs) are responsible for recruiting
DNA repair proteins and activate cell cycle checkpoints. These
PIKKs mainly includes ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated), ATR (ATM
and Rad3 related) and DNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic
subunit) [16]. The response to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs)
and collapsed replication forks is particularly critical for cell survival as
these types of damage are difficult to repair [16]. Thus, tumor cells are
inherently vulnerable to these exogenous DNA damage and DDR inhibition.
This largely explains therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy and
DNA damage-based chemotherapeutics, and also help to develop and
explore DDR-enzyme inhibitors for anti-cancer therapy.
ATM functions to regulate DSBs repair directly or indirectly through
cell cycle checkpoint control, and inhibition or absence of ATM increases
radiosensitivity and chemosensitivity [17–20]. Thus, ATM is an
attractive target for tumor radiosensitization or DNA-damaging chemosensitization.
Recently, small-molecule inhibitors that disrupt ATM
function and sensitize tumor cells to radiation and chemotherapeutic
agents has been developed and explored [19]. One of the first specific
ATM inhibitors was KU-55933, which binds competitively to the ATPbinding
pocket of the ATM kinase [21]. Recently, another ATM inhibitor,
CP466722, was also described [22]. KU-60019 is a novel,
second-generation, and highly specific ATM kinase inhibitor that blocks
radiation-induced DNA damage response [23].
A hallmark of breast cancer is their genomic instability [24], which
often leads to accumulation of lethal DNA damage [25]. It is well
known that radiotherapy and DNA-damaging chemotherapy for cancer
is based on this principle, though it is accompanied by unwanted side
effects on normal tissue [25]. Furthermore, genomic instability is often
caused by defects in DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways [25].
Therefore, targeted therapy based on inhibiting the DDR in cancers
offers the potential for a greater therapeutic window by tailoring
treatment to patients with tumors lacking specific DDR functions [25].
That is, it offers the potential for targeted therapies to exploit the
concept of synthetic lethality, i.e., loss of one cellular pathway results in
high reliance on another pathway that is not essential under normal
settings. This principle is best exemplified by the use of PARP inhibitors
(olaparib) to target DNA repair-deficient tumors [26,27]. In addition, a
previous study showed that fanconi anemia (FA)/BRCA pathway-deficient
tumor cells are hypersensitive to ATM inhibitor [28], indicating
ATM inhibitor could induce synthetic lethality in fanconi anemia (FA) /
BRCA pathway-deficient tumor cells. Recently, ATM inhibition induces
synthetic lethality in PTEN-deficient HCT116 colon cancer cells and
PC3 prostate carcinoma cells [29]. However, the ability of ATM inhibitor
for inducing synthetic lethality in PTEN-deficient breast cancer
cells has not yet been reported.
These observations, combined with the previous reports that PTEN
deficiency leads to defects in DNA repair, promoted us to hypothesize
that ATM inhibitor KU-60019 induces synthetic lethality and enhances
sensitivity of cisplatin to PTEN-deficient breast cancer cells. To test the
hypothesis, we first selected several breast cancer cell lines with different
PTEN status including MDA-MB-231, T47D, MCF-7 (PTEN wildtype,
PTEN WT) as human breast cancer cell models, and MDA-MB-468
(PTEN deletion, PTEN -/-) as human triple-negative breast cancer cell
model, respectively. Then we used these cell lines to test the effects of
ATM inhibitor KU-60019 and / or ciplatin on breast cancer proliferation.
As expected, we observed that KU-60019 enhances sensitivity of
cisplatin in both PTEN-wild type and PTEN-deficient breast cancer cells.
Importantly, we found that KU-60019 induces synthetic lethality in

PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells, and that the cytotoxic
activity of the combination of KU-60019 and cisplatin is higher than
that in PTEN-wild type MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. We further
tried to elucidated the action mechanism for synthetic lethality, and
found that increase of ATM kinase activity and decrease of DNA repair
ability caused by PTEN-deficiency is the main reason for the synthetically
lethal interaction between PTEN and ATM. To our knowledge, we
provide novel molecular evidence for synthetic lethal interaction between
PTEN and ATM in breast cancer, and a new potentially therapeutic
strategy for breast cancer, especially for PTEN-deficient triplenegative
breast cancer.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Reagents and chemicals

MTT, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), PI and DAPI were purchased from
Sigma (St Louis, MO). RIPA buffer were purchased from Beyotime
Biotechnology, China. The following antibodies were used: anti-ATM,

anti-GAPDH (Abways technology, China). Rhodamine (TRITC)
AffiniPure Goat anti-Rabbit IgG was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology;
ATM inhibitor KU-60019 was obtained from Selleck (USA). KU-60019
was dissolved in DMSO and diluted to appropriate concentrations with
cell culture media.

2.2. Cell culture and treatments

Human MDA-MB-231, T47D, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cells were
obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured in DMEM
medium (GIBCO). All culture medium were supplemented with 10%
FBS, penicillin (100 units/mL) and streptomycin (100 μg/mL), respectively,
at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For
single treatment, cells were left untreated or treated with KU-60019 or
cisplatin for an indicated period of time. For combination treatments,
cells were treated with KU-60019 in combination with cisplatin for
48 h. After treatments, cells were harvested and used for the following
experiments including MTT assay, Colony formation assays, flow cytometric
analysis, immunofluorescence microscopy and western blotting
analysis.

2.3. Cell viability and apoptosis assays

Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay [30,31]. Briefly, cells were
plated in 96-well plates at 5 × 103 cells /well and incubated at 37 ℃ in
5% CO2, 95% humidity air for 24 h, and then cells were treated as
described above. MTT was added to the medium (0.5 mg/mL) and incubated
at 37 ℃ for 4 h. The resulting insoluble formazan was dissolved
with DMSO and measured at 570 nm using a spectrophotometer. Data
represent the average of three wells, and the experiment was repeated
three times. Apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry analysis and
detecting the cleavages of PARP.

2.4. Flow cytometry analysis

Apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry using the apoptosis detection
Kit (Tianjin Sungene Biotech Co., Ltd., China) as described
previously [31]. Briefly, cells were harvested and pelleted at 4 °C with
1000 rpm for 5 min, then suspended in 200ul binding buffer, added
with 5 μl Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) solution, treated
for 10 min in room temperature without light. The samples were analyzed
by the use of a flow cytometer (ESP Elite, Coulter, Miami, FL).

2.5. Colony formation assays

Colony formation assays were conducted as described previously
[30,32]. Briefly, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells treated with KU60019
and/or cisplatin for 48 h were harvested and plated in triplicate
at 500 cells/well in 6-well plates and cultured for 10 days. Then the
treated cells were washed twice in PBS, fixed in cold methanol, and
stained with 2% crystal violet. After incubation at room temperature for
20 min, the 6-well plates were washed twice in double-distilled H2O
and dried, and colonies containing more than 50 cells were counted. All
of the experiments were repeated three times, and the average values
were reported.

2.6. Western blot

Protein samples were mixed with loading buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mM dithiothreitol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and
10% glycerol), heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and loaded onto a 12% SDSPAGE
in electrophoresis buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3,
250 mM glycine, and 0.1% SDS. Protein was then transferred to PVDF
using the Trans-Blot semidry system (Bio-Rad). The membranes were
immunoblotted with primary antibodies as described under “Reagents
and chemicals.”

2.7. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy

MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were left untreated or treated
with KU-60019 or cisplatin, and incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at
37 °C for 24 h. After fixation with methanol at − 20 ℃, the cells were
immunostained with monoclonal anti-γ-H2AX (Ser-139) or anti-Rad51
antibodies and subsequently with rhodamine (TRITC) affinipure goat
anti-rabbit IgG and counterstained with DAPI (Invitrogen). The fluorescence
images were visualized with a Zeiss LSM510 Meta upright
confocal microscope. Quantification analysis was performed using
ImageJ software.

2.8. Statistical methods

The statistical analysis was performed with SPSS software (version
17.0 for Windows). Results are presented as mean ± S.D. Analysis of
variance and the Tukey-Kramer multiple-comparison test were used in
comparisons. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

3. Results

3.1. Verification of ATM inhibitor KU-60019 and PTEN status in breast
cancer cells

Previous studies have shown that KU-55933 was first identified as a
specific inhibitor of the ATM kinase [21,23]. Compared with KU55933,
KU-60019, the structure of which is shown in Fig. 1A, was recently
reported to be an improved inhibitor of the ATM kinase. Similarly, we
observed that KU-60019 effectively inhibited cisplatin-induced phosphorylation
of ATM (S1981) at 5μmol/L (Fig. 1B).
Considering that PTEN deficiency is associated with aggressive behavior
and poor prognosis [2,11], we selected several breast cancer cell
with different PTEN status, as cell models to investigate the differential
effects of KU-60019 plus cisplatin on the cell proliferation. These breast
cancer cell lines includes MDA-MB-231 (PTEN WT), T47D (PTEN WT),
MCF-7 (PTEN WT) and MDA-MB-468 (PTEN deletion, PTEN -/-), whose
PTEN status were confirmed by western blot (Fig. 1C and D).

3.2. PTEN-deficient breast cancer cells display increased cytotoxic
sensitivity against KU-60019 and cisplatin

To assess whether KU-60019 inhibits proliferation and enhances the

anti-proliferative effects of cisplatin, we first treated MDA-MB-231 and
MDA-MB-468 cells with cisplatin for 48 h at different concentration,
and found that the dose of IC50 of cisplatin is about 6 μg/mL and 2 μg/
mL, respectively (Fig. 2A). Then, in the following in vitro experiments,
we treated tumor cells with cisplatin at a suboptimal dose (2 μg/mL or
5 μg/mL), with a 48-h interval. After treatment, viability of cells was
detected by MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 2, compared with the control
group, either cisplatin or KU-60019 significantly inhibited the cell
viability of PTEN wild-type MCF-7, T47D and MBA-MB-231 breast
cancer cells and PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells
(Fig. 2B, C and D). Treatment with KU-60019 plus cisplatin further
significantly reduced the cell viability. Importantly, the inhibition
percentage of cell proliferation in PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 was
61.3% (P < 0.01), which was higher than that (39.8%) in PTEN wildtype
MBA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2D).
Based on the observation that PTEN status plays an important role
in the cytotoxic activity of cisplatin plus KU-60019, we mainly selected
PTEN wild-type MBA-MB-231 and PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 cells in
the following experiments to elucidate the underlying action mechanism
for the effect of ATM inhibition on cisplatin sensitivity.

3.3. PTEN-deficient breast cancer cells displays increased suppression of
long-term cell viability by KU-60019 and cisplatin

Considering that MTT assay was used to measure the viability and
short-term survival (up to 72 h) of cells, we measured the long-term
survival of MBA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells after treatments with
KU-60019 and cisplatin by colony-formation assays. Similar to the results
above, the reduced viability of MBA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468
cells was further confirmed by colony formation assays (Fig. 3). Notably,
the colony number of PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 cells treated
with KU-60019 and cisplatin is significantly less than that of PTEN
wild-type MBA-MB-231 cells.

Fig. 1. Confirmation of ATM inhibitor KU-60019 and PTEN status in breast cancer cells
(A) Structure of KU-60019. (B) Inhibition effect of KU-60019 was confirmed by Western
blotting. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were untreated or were treated with 5 μg/mL
cisplatin in the presence or absence of 5 μM KU-60019 for 48 h, and then the levels of
total and phosphorylated ATM were detected by Western blotting. GAPDH was used as a
loading control. (C) PTEN status of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells
was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-PTEN antibody. GAPDH was used as a
loading control. (D) PTEN status of MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cells was confirmed by
Western blotting using anti-PTEN antibody. GAPDH was used as a loading control.

26
Taken together, these results showed that ATM inhibitor KU-60019
can enhance the anti-proliferation effects of cisplatin on breast cancer,
furthermore, the anti-proliferation effects of cisplatin plus KU-60019 on
PTEN-deficient breast cancer cells is stronger than that on PTEN wildtype
breast cancer cells, implying that the survival of PTEN-deficient
breast cells rely more heavily on ATM than PTEN wild-type breast
cancer cells.

3.4. KU-60019 and cisplatin inhibits cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis

Apoptosis plays an important role in reduction of cell viability by
ATM inhibition and/or cisplatin [29,33]. Similarly, we found a significant
increase in the percentage of apoptotic MBA-MB-231 cells and
MBA-MB-468 breast cancer cells treated with KU-60019 and/or cisplatin
for 48 h, as evidenced by the flow cytometry analysis. Furthermore,
the apoptotic percentage of PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 cells
was significantly higher than that of PTEN wild-type MDA-MB-231 cells
(Fig. 4A-C), which is consistent with the above results of proliferation
inhibition. These results indicated that, compared with PTEN wild-type
MDA-MB-468 cells, the survivals of PTEN-deficient breast cells rely
more heavily on ATM dependency. Previous studies have shown that an
early transient burst of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins is
required for apoptosis, followed by cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP), catalyzed by caspase-3 [34,35]. Based on these
observations, we detected the cleavage of PARP in both PTEN wild-type
MDA-MB-231 cells and PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 cells after treatment
with KU-60019 and/or cisplatin. As shown in Fig. 4D, cisplatin
results in PARP cleavage. However, combination of KU-60019 and
cisplatin further caused PARP cleavage. Taken together, these results
suggested that caspase-3-mediated PARP cleavage pathway might be
associated with ATM inhibition and/or cisplatin-induced apoptosis.

3.5. ATM inhibition promotes cisplatin-induced DNA damage accumulation

Since cisplatin can cause DNA damage [36,37], we investigated if

cells display increased cytotoxic sensitivity against
KU-60019 and cisplatin. MTT was carried out to
analyze the survival of breast cancer cells. (A) Effect

ATM inhibition affects cisplatin-induced DNA damage response by γH2AX
staining. As expected, cisplatin or KU-60019 alone produced
some typical γ-H2AX foci in both PTEN wild-type MDA-MB-468 cells
and PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 cells. In contrast, untreated breast
cancer cells display little γ-H2AX foci (Fig. 5). Importantly, KU-60019
significantly augmented cisplatin-induced DNA damage in PTEN-deficient
MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas it slightly (but not significantly) increase
the DNA damage accumulation in PTEN-WT MDA-MB-231 cells,
as evidenced by γ-H2AX staining (Fig. 5B and D). These results indicated
that ATM inhibition promoted cisplatin-induced DNA damage
accumulation, while PTEN deficiency further potentiates the effect of
ATM inhibition on cisplatin-induced DNA damage, finally causing more
DNA damage accumulation.

3.6. ATM inhibition impairs DNA damage repair in cisplatin-induced DNA
damage response

Previous studies have shown that ATM is responsible for recruiting
DNA repair proteins during DDR, contributing to HR-mediated DNA
repair [15,20,25,38]. Thus, we hypothesized that ATM inhibition
would partly impair DNA damage repair, which will further increase
accumulation of cisplatin-induced DNA damage. To confirm if DNA

damage accumulation was caused by defective HR repair due to the
inhibition of ATM activation, an immunofluorescence assay was conducted
to assess RAD51 foci formation, which is indicative of functional
HR repair activity. As shown in Fig. 6, cisplatin or KU-60019 alone
produced some typical Rad51 foci in both PTEN wild-type MDA-MB231
cells and PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 6). Importantly,
ATM inhibitor KU-60019 significantly reduced HR-mediated DNA repair
efficiency, as indicated by the decreased number of RAD51 foci in
cells treated with cisplatin and KU-60019 in both cells (Fig. 6). Notably,
numbers of RAD51 foci in PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 cells were
significantly lower than that in PTEN-WT MDA-MB-231 cells when
treated with KU-60019 plus cisplatin (Fig. 6B and D). These observations
support our hypothesis that ATM inhibition causes the reduction
of HR-mediated DNA repair efficiency, while PTEN deficiency further
impairs HR-mediated DNA repair, finally leading to the accumulation of
DNA damage.

3.7. Mechanistic rationale to selectively target PTEN-deficient tumor cells
with ATM inhibitor KU-60019 and cisplatin

Our data suggest a synthetically lethal interaction between PTEN
and ATM in breast cancer cell lines. However, the mechanism for this

interaction remains elusive. Toward this end, we decided to detect the
expression change of DNA damage response (DDR)-related molecules
between PTEN wild-type and PTEN-deficient breast cancer cells. It has
previously been reported that PTEN-deficient cells exhibit abnormal
homologous recombination (HR)–mediated DNA repair through loss of
expression of Rad51 [12,29,39]. Similarly, we found that the expression
level of endogenous Rad51 in PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 cell lines
was lower than that in PTEN-wild type MDA-MB-231 cell lines
(Fig. 7A). By contrast, the level of γ-H2AX, an indicator of DNA damage,
in PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 cells was higher than that in
PTEN wild-type MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 7A). We further detect DDRrelated
molecules between PTEN wild-type MDA-MB-231 and PTENdeficient
MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in the absence or presence of
cisplatin, and found that, in PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 cell lines, the
expression levels of phospho-ATM, phospho-Chk2 and phospho-H2AX
(γ-H2AX) were higher, while Rad51 was lower, than those in PTENwild
type MDA-MB-231 cell lines (Fig. 7B). The expression differences
of these proteins were further enlarged between the two cells in response
to cisplatin (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, we found that, in PTEN wildtype
MDA-MB-231 and PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 cells treated with
KU-60019 and cisplatin, KU-60019 significantly abrogated cisplatininduced
phosphorylation of Chk1 and Chk2 (Fig. 7C), and caused further
down-regulation of Rad51 as well as up-regulation of γ-H2AX
(Fig. 7D), indicating that KU-60019 plus cisplatin-induced changes of
DDR-related molecules, which reflected reduction of DNA repair and
increase of DNA damage accumulation, might be the reason for KU60019
sensitizes breast cancer cells to cisplatin.

4. Discussion

Breast cancer is one of the most malignant gynecologic cancers
which often cause cancer mortality [2,3]. Hormone receptor-positive
(HR+ ) cancer is the most common breast cancer subtype [5,6], while
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is another breast cancer subtype
with high rate of tumor recurrence, metastasis and the poorest clinical
outcomes [4,7]. Previous studies have shown that PTEN deletion often
occurs in breast cancers, with reduced PTEN protein found in 31–48%
of breast cancers [40,41]. Furthermore, PTEN deficiency is associated
with aggressive behavior and poor prognosis in triple-negative breast
cancers [2,11]. Interestingly, recent reports showed an important nuclear
function of PTEN in DNA double strand break repair [12,29,42].
Synthetic lethal approach is a promising therapy strategy for cancer
treatment [39,43,44]. Based on the “Synthetic lethal” concept, PARP

inhibitor olaparib is approved by FDA to be used to treat BRCA1 or
BRCA2 mutation tumors [43]. Previous studies have shown that ATR
inhibitor AZD-6738 induces synthetic lethality and overcomes chemoresistance
in TP53- or ATM-defective chronic lymphocytic leukemia,
colorectal, lung and gastric cancer cells [44–47]. Similarly, ATM inhibitor
induces synthetic lethality in fanconi anemia (FA) / BRCA
pathway-deficient tumor cells [28]. Recently, McCabe et al. found that
ATM inhibition also induces synthetic lethality in PTEN-deficient
HCT116 colon cancer cells and PC3 prostate carcinoma cells [29].
However, the synthetic lethal interaction between ATM and PTEN has
not been reported in breast cancer cells. The present study was designed
to investigate whether an ATM inhibitor KU-60019 induces synthetic
lethality and enhances sensitivity of cisplatin to PTEN-deficient breast
cancer cells, and to further elucidate the action mechanism for synthetic
lethality.
Several observations have been made in this work concerning inhibition
of proliferation by KU-60019 and/or cisplatin in breast cancer
cells, as evidenced by MTT assay (Fig. 2), colony formation assays
(Fig. 3). Interestingly, the anti-proliferation effects of KU-60019 and
cisplatin on PTEN-deficient breast cancer cells is significantly stronger
than PTEN wild-type breast cancer cells (Figs. 2 and 3), indicating a
synthetic lethal interaction between PTEN and ATM in PTEN-deficient
breast cancer cells.
The reduction of cell viability by ATM inhibition and/or cisplatin
was also associated with induction of apoptosis [29,33]. Similar to
these observations, KU-60019 and/or cisplatin resulted in a significant
increase in the percentage of apoptotic MBA-MB-231 cells and MBAMB-468
breast cancer cells, as evidenced by the flow cytometry analysis
(Fig. 4-C) and detection of PARP cleavage (Fig. 4D). Collectively, these
data showed that apoptosis contributed to the anti-proliferation of
breast cancer cells by KU-60019 and/or cisplatin.
Our data that the anti-proliferation efficiency by KU-60019 and/or
cisplatin in PTEN-deficient MBA-MB-468 cells is higher than PTEN
wild-type MBA-MB-231 cells (Figs. 2–4) promoted us to further explore
the action mechanism. We found that the increase of DNA damage
accumulation and reduction of DNA damage repair also contributed to
the anti-proliferation effects by KU-60019 and/or cisplatin, as indicated
by γ-H2AX staining (Fig. 5) and Rad51 foci (Fig. 6). Importantly, the
accumulation of DNA damage in PTEN-deficient MBA-MB-468 cells is
higher, while the reduction degree of DNA repair is lower, than those in
PTEN wild-type MBA-MB-231 cells (Figs. 5 and 6).
Mechanistically, we found that, compared with PTEN wild-type
MDA-MB-231 cells, PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 cells have lower level

Fig. 7. PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 cells have elevated expression
levels of DNA damage response-related molecules, reduced
levels of RAD51, and activation of ATM. (A) Western blotting for
endogenous Rad51 was performed to determine whether there
was a difference of HR-mediated DNA repair capacity between
PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 cell line and PTEN wild-type MDAMB-231
cell line. GAPDH was used as a loading control. (B)
Western blotting for PTEN, Rad51, γ-H2AX, p-Chk2, ATM and pATM
was performed to determine how cisplatin affects the DDR
pathway between PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 cell line and
PTEN wild-type MDA-MB-231 cell line. MDA-MB-231 and MDAMB-468
cells were untreated or treated with cisplatin for 48 h,
and then used to measure the expression changes of DDR-related
molecules. GAPDH was used as a loading control. (C) Western
blotting for ATM, p-ATM, p-Chk2, Chk2, p-Chk1 and Chk1 was
performed to determine how cisplatin/KU-60019 affect the DDR
pathway between PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 cell line and
PTEN wild-type MDA-MB-231 cell line. MDA-MB-231 and MDAMB-468
cells were untreated or treated with cisplatin/ KU-60019
for 48 h, and then used to measure the expression changes of
DDR-related molecules. GAPDH was used as a loading control. (D)
Western blotting for Rad51 and γ-H2AX was performed to determine
whether the reduction of DNA damage accumulation in PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 cells is due to a decreased HR repair capacity. PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 and PTEN wildtype
MDA-MB-231 cells were untreated or treated with cisplatin/KU-60019 for 48 h, and then used to measure the expression changes of Rad51 and γ-H2AX. GAPDH was used as a
loading control.

of Rad51 expression (Fig. 7A), which is similar to the previous reports
that PTEN-deficient cells exhibit defective DNA repair through loss of
RAD51, an indicative of HR-mediated DNA repair [12,29,39]. Furthermore,
PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 cells were observed to have
higher constitutive ATM kinase activity than PTEN wild-type MDA-MB231
cells, as indicated by the phosphorylation of ATM and its substrate
Chk2 (Fig. 7B), indicating that ATM as a target in PTEN-deficient breast
cancers is better than PTEN wild-type breast cancers. The differences of
ATM kinase activity in the two cell lines were further augmented by
cisplatin (Fig. 7B). Similar to this observation, the differences of
phosphorylation of H2AX (γ-H2AX), the indicative of DNA damage
[29,31], were also observed (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, KU-60019 significantly
abrogated cisplatin-induced phosphorylation of Chk2 and
Chk1 (Fig. 7C), and further caused down-regulation of Rad51 as well as
up-regulation of γ-H2AX (Fig. 7D). Taken together, our data explain at
the molecular level why PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 cells display the
elevated levels of DNA damage, the decreased capability of DNA repair
and the increased cytotoxic sensitivity against KU-60019 and cisplatin,
compared to PTEN wild-type MDA-MB-231 cells.
In summary, we have shown that ATM inhibitor KU-60019 induces
synthetic lethality in PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells,
and enhances sensitivity of cisplatin in both PTEN-wild type and PTENdeficient
breast cancer cells. We have further demonstrated a requirement
for ATM in the maintenance of cell survival in the presence of
increased DNA damage secondary to PTEN deficiency. The preferentially
selective sensitivity of PTEN deficient breast cancers to ATM
inhibitor KU-60019 and cisplatin suggests that this may represent a
novel approach to targeted breast cancer therapy. To our knowledge,
we provide a novel therapeutic strategy for breast cancer, especially for
PTEN-deficient triple-negative breast cancer.
