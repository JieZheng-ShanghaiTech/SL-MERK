 ABSTRACT Here, we use a large-scale cell line–based approach to identify cancer cell–specifi c
mutations that are associated with DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit
(DNA-PKcs) dependence. For this purpose, we profi led the mutational landscape across 1,319 cancerassociated
genes of 67 distinct cell lines and identifi ed numerous genes involved in homologous recombination–mediated
DNA repair, including BRCA1 , BRCA2 , ATM , PAXIP , and RAD50 , as being associated with
non-oncogene addiction to DNA-PKcs. Mutations in the mismatch repair gene MSH3 , which have been
reported to occur recurrently in numerous human cancer entities, emerged as the most signifi cant predictors
of DNA-PKcs addiction. Concordantly, DNA-PKcs inhibition robustly induced apoptosis in MSH3 -
mutant cell lines in vitro and displayed remarkable single-agent effi cacy against MSH3 -mutant tumors
in vivo . Thus, we here identify a therapeutically actionable synthetic lethal interaction between MSH3 and
the non-homologous end joining kinase DNA-PKcs. Our observations recommend DNA-PKcs inhibition as
a therapeutic concept for the treatment of human cancers displaying homologous recombination defects.
 SIGNIFICANCE: We associate mutations in the MSH3 gene, which are frequently detected in microsatellite-instable
colon cancer (∼40%), with a therapeutic response to specifi c DNA-PKcs inhibitors.
Because potent DNA-PKcs inhibitors are currently entering early clinical trials, we offer a novel opportunity
to genetically stratify patients who may benefi t from a DNA-PKcs–inhibitory therapy. Cancer

 INTRODUCTION
 In response to DNA damage, cells activate a complex signaling
cascade to prevent further cell-cycle progression ( 1 ). Activation
of this signaling pathway, which is commonly referred
to as the DNA damage response (DDR), allows time for DNA
repair, or, if the lesions are beyond repair capacity, leads to the
induction of apoptosis ( 1 ). Mammalian cells have evolved at
least fi ve partially overlapping DNA repair pathways to correct
various types of genotoxic lesions—mismatch repair (MMR),
nucleotide-excision repair (NER), base-excision repair (BER),
homologous recombination, and non-homologous end joining
(NHEJ; ref. 2 ). MMR removes nucleotides that were mispaired
during replication, as well as insertion and deletion
loops, which result from slippage during the replication of
repetitive sequences. The NER pathway is used to repair helixdistorting
lesions, whereas small chemical modifi cations of
bases are removed by the BER machinery ( 2 ).
 Specifi cally in response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSB),
mammalian cells use two distinct repair pathways. NHEJ is an

error-prone pathway that is preferentially used during early
phases of the cell cycle, when no sister chromatid is available
( 3 ). During NHEJ, the noncatalytic subunits KU70 and KU80
form a heterodimer that binds to the free DNA ends and subsequently
recruits the catalytic subunit DNA-PKcs (encoded by
PRKDC ). DNA-PKcs kinase activity is essential for XRCC4- and
LIG4-mediated rejoining of the broken DNA ends during NHEJ
( 4 ). Homologous recombination, the second major DSB repair
pathway, is largely restricted to the S- and G 2 -phases of the cell
cycle, when a sister chromatid is available to serve as an intact
template for DSB repair ( 5 ). One of the early events, necessary
for completion of the homologous recombination process,
is DSB end resection to create a single-stranded 3′-overhang,
which becomes rapidly coated with the single-strand-binding
protein replication protein A (RPA) and provides a substrate
for activation of the proximal DDR kinase ATR ( 6 ). During the
ensuing steps of the homologous recombination process, RPA
is replaced by RAD51, which is recruited to ssDNA in a BRCA1/
BRCA2/PALB2–dependent fashion ( 7 ). Once loaded onto
ssDNA, RAD51 mediates the core reactions of the homologous
recombination process, namely homology searching, strand
exchange, and Holliday junction formation ( 5 ).
 The homologous recombination pathway is indispensable
for the maintenance of genomic integrity, and patients with
heterozygous germline mutations in different homologous
recombination genes display a massively increased risk for the
development of cancer ( 7 ). Most notably, germline mutations
in BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and RAD51C are associated with predisposition
to breast and ovarian cancer ( 8, 9 ). Furthermore,
numerous homologous recombination genes, including
BRCA1 , BRCA2 , ATM , CHEK2 , RAD50 , RAD51C , and others, are
recurrently somatically mutated in various different cancer
entities ( 7 ).
 Intriguingly, homologous recombination defi ciency in
BRCA1 - or BRCA2 -defective cells and tumors was recently shown

to represent an actionable alteration in cancer. Specifi cally, a
series of recent studies reported a synthetic lethal interaction
between PARP1 and the high-penetrance breast and ovarian
cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 ( 10, 11 ). In
addition, we and others have recently identifi ed a druggable
synthetic lethal interaction between the homologous recombination
gene ATM and the NHEJ kinase gene PRKDC ( 12–14 ).
Here, we propose that it is the homologous recombination
defect that is responsible for the robust non-oncogene addiction
to DNA-PKcs that we had previously observed in ATM -
mutant cells and tumors ( 14 ). Thus, the aim of this study was
to compile a systematic classifi cation of the most frequent
mutations in cancer, which are most likely to be associated with
an actionable DNA-PKcs addiction. To this end, we used a combined
genomic and chemical vulnerability analysis of 94 cancer
cell lines and examined the effect of mutations in 1,319 cancerassociated
genes on DNA-PKcs dependence. Furthermore, we
functionally confi rmed the most striking associations that we
identifi ed in high-throughput screening and deciphered mechanisms
that might rationalize these effects. Finally, we provide a
detailed examination of our novel therapeutic strategies in vivo .

 RESULTS
 Activity Profi le of KU60648 in a Large Panel of
Genomically Annotated Cancer Cell Lines
 To identify genomic aberrations that are associated with
non-oncogene addiction to the NHEJ kinase DNA-PKcs, we
screened the specifi c DNA-PKcs inhibitor KU60648 (IC 50 =
19 nmol/L ; ref. 15 ) against a panel of 94 genomically wellannotated
cancer cell lines (Supplementary Table S1), which
covered a broad spectrum of cancer entities, histologic subtypes
(Supplementary Fig. S1A, inset), and cancer-associated
genomic aberrations ( Fig. 1A and B ). We used the BRD4–
NUT -fused cell line HCC2429 as a positive control ( Fig. 1A
and Supplementary Table S1), for which we had recognized
addiction to DNA-PKcs in follow-up experiments of a previous
study ( 14 ). Conversely, A375 and A549 cells, which we
had previously shown to be resistant to the DNA-PKcs
inhibitor KU60648, were included to benchmark DNA-PKcs
independence ( 14 ). Cell viability was assessed using highthroughput
luminescence-based measurements of relative
cellular ATP content by CellTiter-Glo assay.
 To identify genomic aberrations that are associated with
DNA-PKcs addiction, we systematically linked compound
activity in 67 cell lines to mutation status of 1,319 cancerassociated
genes ( Fig. 1B and C ; Supplementary Figs. S1 and
S2; refs. 16–20 ). We analyzed Hill coeffi cients and nearestneighbor
distances to identify 400 nmol/L as the threshold
concentration for KU60648 sensitivity (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). We used this threshold to classify cell lines into
KU60648-sensitive and -resistant groups. Comparing for each
gene its mutation frequency between the two cohorts (Fisher
exact test), we identifi ed 121 genes, for which mutations
signifi cantly ( P < 0.05) coclustered with KU60648 sensitivity,
as well as MAP3K1 mutations, which emerged as the only
signifi cant ( P = 0.048) genomic marker predicting KU60648
resistance ( Fig. 1B ). We note that mutations in PRKDC were
strongly associated with KU60648 resistance, suggesting that
the compound was indeed targeting DNA-PKcs.

 We initially hypothesized that NHEJ abrogation through
DNA-PKcs inhibition should selectively eradicate homologous
recombination–defective cells. Consistent with this
notion, mutations in the homologous recombination genes
BRCA2 ( P = 1.06 × 10 −4 ), RAD50 ( P = 3.99 × 10 −3 ), CHEK2
( P = 5.97 × 10 −3 ), and PAXIP ( P = 1.33 × 10 −4 , encoding PTIP),
as well as the Fanconi anemia pathway component FANCD2
( P = 5.97 × 10 −3 ), emerged as lesions that signifi cantly coclustered
with KU60648 sensitivity. Mutations in different components
of the PTIP–MLL3–MLL4 complex, which plays a critical role
in RAG-mediated cleavage and repair during V(D)J recombination
( 21 ), as well as homologous recombination–mediated
DSB repair ( 22 ), emerged as highly signifi cant determinants
of DNA-PKcs dependence ( Fig. 1B ). Specifi cally, frameshift
mutations in MLL3 (encoding the PTIP-interacting protein
MLL3; P = 9.32 × 10 −4 ) were identifi ed as signifi cant predictors
for non-oncogene addiction to the NHEJ kinase DNA-PKcs.
Furthermore, mutations in ATM and BRCA1 were also associated
with KU60648 sensitivity (Supplementary Fig. S2). Although
displaying strong effects (GI 50 ratio ≥ 3.5), these associations
did not meet signifi cance criteria, either due to the low mutation
frequency of these genes in the examined cancer lines
(e.g., BRCA1 ; n = 3) or due to dissimilar effects on compound
activity depending on the respective mutation type (e.g., ATM );
exclusively frameshift mutations of the latter coclustered signifi
cantly with compound activity (Supplementary Fig. S2).
In agreement with our initial hypothesis, a Gene Ontology
(GO)–based analysis ( 23 ) revealed that disabling mutations
in DNA repair genes were signifi cantly ( P = 2.98 × 10 −12 )
enriched in DNA-PKcs inhibitor-sensitive cell lines ( Fig. 1A ,
inset). In particular, we observed an accumulation of homologous
recombination genes, for which mutations were signifi -
cantly associated with KU60648 sensitivity. The initial steps of
the homologous recombination pathway can be arbitrarily
clustered into three distinct processes, namely focus nucleation,
DSB resection, and RAD51 loading ( Fig. 1C ); our screen
revealed mutations in critical components of each process ( Fig.
1C ). These data suggest that homologous recombination defi -
ciency in general represents a cancer-associated condition that
displays synthetic lethality with the NHEJ kinase DNA-PKcs.
 To our surprise, mutations in the MMR gene MSH3 ( P =
9.53 × 10 −4 ) emerged among the most signifi cant predictors
of compound activity ( Fig. 1B ). Further analysis revealed that
MSH3 mutations gained strongly in signifi cance ( P = 7.43 ×
10 −6 ) and activity effect (GI 50 ratio, 5.3) when restricted to
 protein structure–damaging microdeletions in the two longest
mononucleotide/trinucleotide repeat sequences of the MSH3
coding sequence ( Fig. 1A and B and Supplementary Figs. S2 and
S3A). Intriguingly, frameshift mutations in A 8 stretches occur
frequently as somatic alterations of MSH3 in microsatelliteinstable
(MSI) colorectal cancer ( 24–27 ). Concordantly, we
detected such mutations in our cancer cell line panel; 10 of 67
cell lines displayed microdeletions in the two longest mononucleotide/trinucleotide
repeat sequences ( Fig. 1A and Supplementary
Fig. S3A). Together, our observations strongly suggest
that DNA-PKcs inhibition might emerge as a novel therapeutic
principle for the targeted treatment of MSH3 -defective cancer.
 In our initial screen, we noticed that only two of a total of
three BRCA1 -mutant cell lines were classifi ed as KU60648-sensitive
(H1838 and H1563). To molecularly dissect this diverse

pattern of compound sensitivity, we subjected the BRCA1 mut
cell lines H2347, H1563, and H1838 to Sanger sequencing
of all 23 BRCA1 exons (Supplementary Fig. S3B–S3D) and
found that only the H1563 cell line carried homozygous
BRCA1 mutations. Intriguingly, KU60648-sensitive H1838
cells did not show homozygous BRCA1 mutations. However,
they carried an MSH3 mutation ( Fig. 1A ), which likely rationalizes
their KU60648 sensitivity.

 DNA-PKcs Inhibition Induces Apoptosis in
MSH3 -Mutant Cells
 The CellTiter-Glo assays revealed that MSH3 -mutant
cell lines displayed a robust DNA-PKcs inhibitor response

( Pmax = 7.81 × 10 −6 , t test; Supplementary Fig. S1C). To
address the characteristics of the apparent reduction of cell
viability that we observed in MSH3 -mutant cells, we next
quantifi ed KU60648-induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis
using immunoblotting ( Fig. 2A ) and fl ow cytometry ( Fig.
2B and Supplementary Fig. S4). To this end, cell-cycle profi
les of a panel of six sensitive (HCC44, H1838, H1703,
H2030, H1563, and HCC2429) and three resistant (H2347,
HCC1359, and H1915) cell lines were longitudinally monitored
at seven distinct time points under 1 μmol/L exposure
of KU60648 (0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours). H1563 cells

carry a BRD4–NUT fusion, were included as positive controls.
Upon completion of drug exposure, cells were stained with
propidium iodide (PI), and relative cellular DNA content
was assessed by fl ow cytometry. As shown in Supplementary
Fig. S4, all nine cell lines displayed an early prominent loss
of the S-phase populations (6 and 12 hours), followed by
a subsequent decrease of cells with 4N DNA content (24
hours). Intriguingly, KU60648-resistant cell lines showed a
remarkable reconstitution to the initial cell-cycle profi les of
untreated cells (Supplementary Fig. S4), strongly suggesting
full cell-cycle checkpoint recovery and restart of proliferation.
In marked contrast, all KU60648-sensitive cells had a persistent
loss of S- and G 2 –M populations (Supplementary Fig. S4),
rationalizing the results of our CellTiter-Glo–based screen
( Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1C). To validate these

distinct cellular response patterns, we next used immunoblotting
( Fig. 2A ). Exposure of the MSH3 -mutant cell lines
HCC44, H1838, and HCT116, as well as the positive control
HCC2429 to 1 μmol/L KU60648 (48 hours), resulted in a substantial
loss of S-phase cyclin A2 expression, corroborating
the persistent cell-cycle arrest observed in our fl ow cytometry
experiments ( Fig. 2A , top). In contrast, the MSH3 -profi cient
control lines H2347, H1568, HCC1359, and H1915 displayed
continued cyclin A2 expression after 48-hour treatment with
1 μmol/L of KU60648 ( Fig. 2A , bottom).
 We next asked whether the KU60648-sensitive cell lines
also displayed signs of apoptotic cell death. Therefore, we
used immunoblotting to detect cleaved caspase-3, as a marker
for apoptosis. Consistent with the results of our initial screen,
the sensitive cell lines HCC44, H1838, and HCT116 and the

Non-oncogene Addiction to DNA-PKcs in Homologous Recombination–Defective Cancers RESEARCH ARTICLE

positive control HCC2429 displayed cleavage of caspase-3
after KU60648 treatment (1 μmol/L, 48 hours), indicating
execution of apoptosis ( Fig. 2A , top). In marked contrast, no
caspase-3 cleavage could be observed after KU60648 treatment
(1 μmol/L, 48 hours) in the MSH3 -profi cient control
lines H2347, H1568, HCC1359, and H1915 ( Fig. 2A , bottom).
 To further validate KU60648-induced apoptosis with an
independent assay, we used fl ow cytometry ( Fig. 2B ) and stained
cells with annexin-V and PI after 72 hours of KU60648 exposure
(0, 0.1, 0.5, and 1 μmol/L). We note that the resistant cells had
shown full recovery of proliferation after 72 hours of sustained
KU60648 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4). As indicated by
the appearance of a large annexin-V/PI double-positive population
in the MSH3 -mutant cells following KU60648 exposure,
the reduced viability that we observed in the initial screen
was likely attributable to massive apoptosis ( Fig. 2B ). Similar
effects were observed in the positive control lines (HCC2429,
BRD4–NUT , and H1563, BRCA1 -mutant). In contrast, even 1
μmol/L of KU60648 did not result in any substantial apoptosis
in MSH3 -profi cient control cells ( P = 0.011; Fig. 2B ).
 As KU60648 treatment has been reported to induce DSBs,
we next asked whether the DSB-inducing anthracycline drug
doxorubicin might synergistically enhance KU60648 activity in
MSH3 -mutant cells. For this purpose, we examined the effect
of 120 different concentration combinations of KU60648 and
doxorubicin on three MSH3 -mutant (HCT116, HCC44, and
H1838) and three control lines (H1915, H1568, and HCC1359;
Supplementary Fig. S5A). We used CellTiter-Glo assays as readout
for cellular viability after 48 and 96 hours of compound
exposure. For each concentration, we compared the observed
residual viability with the expected viability, assuming additive
effects of both compounds (Bliss independence; Supplementary
Fig. S5A). We found that doxorubicin was active on
most cells examined, without discriminating between MSH3 -
defi cient and -profi cient lines. However, the effect of doxorubicin
(50–250 nmol/L) was synergistically enhanced by cotreatment
with KU60648 (∼1 μmol/L) for MSH3 -defi cient cell lines
only; additive effects of both compounds were observed for the
MSH3 -profi cient controls (Supplementary Fig. S5A).
 We next compared apoptosis levels under cotreatment with
KU60648 (1 μmol/L) and doxorubicin (0, 30, 100, 250, and
1,000 nmol/L) with induction of apoptosis under single-agent
therapy. Again, we detected synergistic induction of apoptosis
exquisitely for MSH3 -defi cient cell lines at low and variable
concentrations of doxorubicin (Supplementary Fig. S5B).
 In summary, our experiments underscore the functional relevance
of the observations made in our high-throughput cell
line–based screen. These data strongly suggest that DNA-PKcs
inhibition results in the apoptotic demise of MSH3 -mutant
cells ( Fig. 2A and B and Supplementary Fig. S4). The cytotoxic
effect of KU60648 on MSH3 -mutant cells can be further
increased by combination with low concentrations of doxorubicin.
However, this combination is less discriminative between
MSH3 -defi cient and -profi cient cells (Supplementary Fig. S6).
 Genetic Validation of the Apparent Synthetic
Lethality between MSH3 and PRKDC
 As studies with ATP-competitive inhibitors are frequently
hampered by off-target effects, we next performed genetic
experiments to functionally confi rm DNA-PKcs (encoded

by PRKDC ) as the target of KU60648 in MSH3 -mutant and
BRCA1 -defective cell lines ( Fig. 2C and D and Supplementary
Figs. S6–S8). We used RNA interference (RNAi) to deplete
DNA-PKcs in four sensitive and two resistant control lines
( Fig. 2C ). Knockdown effi ciency was confi rmed by immunoblotting
(Supplementary Fig. S6). Confi rming that repression
of DNA-PKcs expression leads to the induction of apoptosis
in MSH3 -mutant settings, we reproducibly detected cleavage
of caspase-3 in KU60648-sensitive cell lines (HCC44 and
HCC2429), 120 hours following viral short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) delivery (Supplementary Fig. S6). Next, we assessed
the effects of RNAi-mediated repression of PRKDC in colony
formation assays ( Fig. 2C ). Two weeks after viral RNAi delivery,
we observed complete eradication of KU60648-sensitive
HCC44, H1703, HCC2429, and H1563 lines, whereas
KU60648-resistant H1568 and HCC1359 lines did not exhibit
any signs of morphologic change ( Fig. 2C ).
 We next examined whether other components of the NHEJ
pathway might be similarly synthetically lethal with MSH3 .
DNA damage repair by NHEJ is initiated by a complex formed
by the proteins KU70 (encoded by XRCC6 ) and KU80 (encoded
by XRCC5 ). Hence, we compiled fi ve shRNA constructs specifi
cally targeting KU80 and transduced four independent
cell lines (HCT116 [ MSH3 mut ], HCC44 [ MSH3 mut ], HCC1359
[cntrl], and H1568 [cntrl]) with each of these constructs. We
assessed knockdown effi ciency by immunoblotting (Supplementary
Fig. S7A) to choose two shRNAs (sh XRCC5 #1 and
sh XRCC5 #3) that effectively silenced expression of KU80.
 In colony formation assays, we observed mild growtharrestive
effects of KU80 depletion in the MSH3 -profi cient
cell lines, indicating that KU80 is critical for cell survival
in general (Supplementary Fig. S7B and S7C). In contrast,
strong cytotoxic effects were detected in MSH3 -defi cient cells
for both constructs targeting KU80 (Supplementary Fig. S7B
and S7C). Therefore, shRNA-mediated suppression of an
independent NHEJ protein had similar cytotoxic effects in
MSH3 -defi cient cells as knockdown of PRKDC .
 Next, we compared the KU60648 response of Msh3 -profi -
cient and Msh3 -defi cient murine embryonic fi broblasts (MEF)
to validate Msh3 defi ciency as a genetic determinant of DNAPKcs
addiction (Supplementary Fig. S8A). In brief, we fi rst
assessed KU60648 potency in Msh3 wt/wt and Msh3−/− MEFs
using CellTiter-Glo assays under the same conditions as
in our initial screen. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S8B,
Msh3 -defi cient MEFs were signifi cantly more sensitive to
DNA-PKcs inhibition than their isogenic Msh3 -profi cient
counterparts ( P = 9.33 × 10 −5 ). To further characterize the
nature of this response, we assessed KU60648-induced apoptosis
by immunoblotting and fl ow cytometry ( Fig. 2D and
Supplementary Fig. S8C). We observed caspase-3 cleavage
(Supplementary Fig. S8C) and the appearance of an annexinV/PI
double-positive population ( Fig. 2D ) in Msh3 -defi cient
MEFs, strongly suggesting that DNA-PKcs inhibition results
in apoptosis in Msh3 -defective settings. In stark contrast,
neither caspase-3 cleavage nor appearance of an annexin-V/PI
double-positive apoptotic population could be detected in
Msh3 -profi cient MEFs ( Fig. 2D and Supplementary Fig. S8C).
Together, genetic repression of PRKDC in MSH3 -mutant
cells, on the one hand ( Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig.

Msh3 -defi cient cells, on the other hand ( Fig. 2D and Supplementary
Fig. S8), cross-validated the proposed synthetic
lethal interaction between these two genes. Furthermore, the
cytotoxic effects, which we observed in MSH3 -mutant cells
under suppression of KU80 expression (Supplementary Fig.
S7), might suggest a generalizable synthetic lethal interaction
between the homologous recombination and NHEJ pathways.
MSH3 -Defective Cell Lines Display a Defect in
Homologous Recombination–Based DSB Repair
 Our initial screen revealed that alterations in homologous
recombination–mediated DSB repair are associated with
DNA-PKcs inhibitor sensitivity ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary
Figs. S1 and S2). Thus, we next asked whether homologous
recombination defects were responsible for the DNAPKcs
addiction that we observed in MSH3 -mutant cells. To
this end, we transiently incubated MSH3 -profi cient (H1568,
HCC1359, and Msh3 wt/wt
 MEFs) and MSH3 -defective (HCC44,
H1838, HCT116, RL95-2, H1703, and Msh3−/− MEFs) cells
with the DSB-inducing topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide
(0.1 μmol/L, 1-hour pulse) to induce tractable DSBs. As
BRCA1 loss-of-function had previously been shown to result
in severely impaired homologous recombination–mediated
DSB repair ( 7 , 11 ), we also studied the BRCA1 -mutant H1563
cell line ( Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S9A).
 To examine the DSB repair kinetics in our cell line panel, we
used indirect immunofl uorescence to monitor the persistence
of etoposide-induced γ-H2AX nuclear foci as an established
marker for unrepaired DSBs ( 1 ). We observed robust formation
of γ-H2AX nuclear foci in all cell lines that were analyzed 4
hours following removal of etoposide ( Fig. 3A and B and Supplementary
Fig. S9A), whereas no nuclear γ-H2AX foci could be
detected in untreated cells. However, 72 hours after etoposide
removal, these foci had disappeared in all cell lines ( Fig. 3A and
B and Supplementary Fig. S9A), suggesting that both MSH3 -
profi cient and MSH3 -defective, as well as BRCA1 -mutant, cells
were capable of repairing etoposide-induced DSBs.
 In a parallel set of experiments, we stained these cells with
an antibody detecting RAD51 nuclear foci ( Fig. 3A and C and
Supplementary Fig. S9A), which are a hallmark feature of
ongoing homologous recombination–mediated DSB repair
( 11 ). Of note, BRCA1 -defi cient cells were previously shown
to lack RAD51 foci formation in response to DSB-inducing
agents ( 7 , 11 ). As shown in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S9A,
the MSH3 - and BRCA1 -profi cient H1568 and HCC1359, as
well as wild-type MEFs, displayed prominent nuclear RAD51
foci 4 hours after the removal of etoposide, suggesting functional
homologous recombination–mediated DSB repair.
Nuclear RAD51 foci were not detectable in these cell lines
72 hours after etoposide removal, suggesting complete DSB
repair. In marked contrast, RAD51 foci could not be detected
within a 72-hour time frame after etoposide removal in
either the MSH3 -defective (HCC44, H1838, HCT116, RL95-2,
H1703, and Msh3−/− MEFs) or the BRCA1 -mutant H1563 cells
( P = 2.3 × 10 −3 ; Fig. 3A and C and Supplementary Fig. S9A).
These data strongly suggest that the homologous recombination–mediated
repair of etoposide-induced DSBs is substantially
impaired in MSH3 -mutant cells. Similar effects have
been previously described for BRCA1 defi ciency ( Fig. 3A and
C ; ref. 11 ).

 Homologous Recombination Defi ciency
Rationalizes the Synthetic Lethality between
MSH3 and PRKDC
 Given the substantial homologous recombination defect that
we had observed in MSH3 -mutant cells ( Fig. 3 and Supplementary
Fig. S9A), we next hypothesized that pharmacologic NHEJ
abrogation through DNA-PKcs inhibition might lead to the generation
of persistent unrepaired DSBs in these cells. To directly
test this hypothesis, we induced DSBs in homologous recombination–profi
cient (H1568, HCC1359, and Msh3 wt/wt
 MEFs)
and homologous recombination-defective (HCC44 [ MSH3 mut ],
H1838 [ MSH3 mut ], HCT116 [MSH3mut], RL95-2 [MSH3mut],
H1703 [ MSH3 mut], Msh3−/− MEFs, and H1563 [ BRCA1 mut]) cells
by applying an etoposide pulse (0.1 μmol/L, 1 hour) in the
absence or continued presence of 0.5 μmol/L of KU60648. Cells
were protected from premature apoptosis by the addition of the
irreversible pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD (10 μmol/L), which
was applied together with etoposide. Similar to the experiments
detailed in Fig. 3 , we performed immunofl uorescence to detect
nuclear γ-H2AX and RAD51 foci ( Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig.
S9B). Recruitment of RAD51, the core component of the homologous
recombination machinery, to DSBs requires prior resection
of DNA ends to generate RPA-coated 3′ ssDNA overhangs
( 28 ). To monitor the occurrence of 3′ ssDNA repair intermediates
in our cell line panel, we thus also included a set of experiments
in which we monitored nuclear RPA1 foci as a marker for
ssDNA. As shown in Fig. 4A–Cand Supplementary Fig. S9B, 4
hours after etoposide removal, prominent γ-H2AX foci could
be detected in all cell lines, in both the absence or presence of
KU60648. No γ-H2AX foci could be detected in the absence of
KU60648 72 hours following etoposide removal. Similarly, we
observed no γ-H2AX foci in the homologous recombination–
profi cient cells 72 hours after etoposide pulse treatment, even
when KU60648 was present. In stark contrast and consistent
with a severe DSB repair defect, γ-H2AX foci could be visualized
72 hours following etoposide removal in the homologous
recombination–defective cells that were continuously exposed to
KU60648. Intriguingly, the staining patterns for RPA1 foci were
identical to those observed for γ-H2AX foci ( Fig. 4A, D, and E and
Supplementary Fig. S9B). The persistent presence of RPA1 foci
in homologous recombination–defective cells that were treated
with KU60648 strongly suggests that DSBs are resected in these
cells. However, the continued presence of γ-H2AX foci indicates
that DSBs cannot be repaired in homologous recombination–
defective cells when NHEJ is pharmacologically abrogated. In
summary, our immunofl uorescence data lend strong support
to the hypothesis that MSH3 mutations result in a homologous
recombination defect. Impaired homologous recombination
profi ciency renders MSH3 -mutant cells dependent on functional
DNA-PKcs–mediated NHEJ to repair DSBs.

In Vivo Validation of DNA-PKcs as an Actionable
Target in MSH3 -Defective Tumors
 Human tumors frequently display an activated DDR, likely
as a result of stalled replication forks and DSBs ( 29–31 ). These
genotoxic lesions are thought to be the molecular equivalent
of oncogene-induced replicative stress and unscheduled
replication fi ring ( 29 , 32 ). This presence of genotoxic stress
in otherwise untreated human neoplastic lesions led us to

Non-oncogene Addiction to DNA-PKcs in Homologous Recombination–Defective Cancers RESEARCH ARTICLE

investigate whether endogenous DNA damage, specifi cally in
homologous recombination–defective tumors, might offer a
therapeutic window for the use of DNA-PKcs inhibitors in vivo .
The strong and robust effects that we observed in homologous
recombination–defective MSH3 -mutant cells under DNA-PKcs
inhibition in vitro ( Figs. 1 and 2 ) motivated us to further assess
its effi ciency as a single agent in vivo . To this end, we used an
NMRI nu/ nu xenograft mouse model to study therapeutic drug
response in vivo . In brief, we subcutaneously engrafted nude
mice either with KRAS -driven, MSH3 -mutant HCT116 cells, or
with MYC/HRAS G12V double-transduced Msh3 -defi cient MEFs
( Fig. 5A–E and Supplementary Fig. S10A–S10F). For negative
controls, we used either KRAS -mutant A549 cells or MYC/
HRAS G12V double-transduced Msh3 -profi cient MEFs ( Fig. 5A–E
and Supplementary Fig. S10A–S10F).
 As described previously ( 14 ), we administered 40 mg/kg
doses of the DNA-PKcs inhibitor KU60648 twice daily (intraperitoneal
injection). Intriguingly, we observed a substantial
(fi nal tumor volume, 31.5%) and signifi cant ( P = 3.1 × 10 −4 ;
 Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S10A and S10E) tumor volume
shrinkage for HCT116-driven tumors under KU60648
therapy within 14 days, whereas A549 control tumors were
completely resistant and even showed continued volume gains
under KU60648 therapy ( Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig.
S10B and S10F). To further compare the tumor proliferation
rate between both therapy groups, we stained tumor samples
with Ki67-specifi c antibodies after 14-day therapy ( Fig.
5E ). Shrinkage of HCT116 tumors translated into complete
eradication of the Ki67-positive cell fraction under KU60648
therapy. In marked contrast, the Ki67 staining of A549 tumors
remained stable between control and therapy groups, indicating
their maintained proliferation under therapy ( Fig. 5E ).
 Tumors driven by MYC/HRAS G12V double-transduced MEFs

A549–driven tumors ( Fig. 5C and D and Supplementary Fig.
S10C and S10D). Thus, tumor volumes could be followed
for only 7 days before control animals had to be sacrifi ced.
Despite this highly aggressive growth behavior, therapy with
KU60648 resulted in stable disease (fi nal tumor volume, 109%)
of Msh3−/− MEF-driven lesions, whereas we did not observe any
signifi cant therapeutic effect of KU60648 on Msh3 wt/wt MEFdriven
tumors ( Fig. 5C and D and Supplementary Fig. S10C
and S10D). In summary, our results strongly recommend
DNA-PKcs as a promising drug target for the rational design of
personalized therapies for homologous recombination–defective
neoplastic disease. Specifi cally, the therapeutic effect on
Msh3 -knockout MEFs and tumors derived from these cells confi
rms that loss-of-function mutations in MSH3 are genetic and
functional predictors of DNA-PKcs inhibitor activity in vivo .

 DISCUSSION
 Alterations in Homologous Recombination
Signaling Are Associated with DNA-PKcs Addiction
 Eukaryotic cells have evolved a plethora of DNA repair pathways,
which together function to maintain genomic integrity of
multicellular organisms ( 2 ). Perhaps not surprisingly, inactivating
mutations in these DNA repair pathways are commonly
observed in human tumors and are thought to fuel a “mutator
phenotype” ( 33–35 ). For instance, cancer genome resequencing
data suggest that approximately 50% of high-grade serous ovarian
carcinomas are homologous recombination defective ( 36 ).
 We have previously reported an actionable synthetic lethal
interaction between the homologous recombination gene
ATM and the critical NHEJ gene PRKDC ( 13, 14 , 37 ). In
addition, the combined knockout of ATM and PRKDC was
recently shown to result in embryonic lethality at E7.5 in
mice ( 12 ). Intriguingly, E7.5 is a developmental stage at which
embryonic cells are hypersensitive to DNA damage ( 12 ). On
the basis of these observations, we hypothesized that mutations
in additional homologous recombination genes might
be associated with a similar DNA-PKcs addiction.
 To systematically decipher additional genetic aberrations
that are associated with DNA-PKcs addiction, we fi rst linked
large-scale sequencing data ( 16 ) to high-throughput KU60648
activity profi ling across 67 cancer cell lines ( Fig. 1 ). As reported
recently ( 38 ), potency and selectivity of several compounds are
underestimated, if analysis is restricted to their half maximal
growth-inhibitory concentrations (GI 50 ). Hence, we amended
our interpretation of the cell line screen by Hill coeffi cients and
nearest-neighbor distances (Supplementary Fig. S1). Using this
approach, we found that mutations in genes involved in DNA
repair ( P = 2.98 × 10 −12 ) signifi cantly associated with KU60648
sensitivity. More precisely, we were able to confi rm mutations
in several genes with a known role in homologous recombination–mediated
DSB repair, including BRCA1 , BRCA2 , ATM ,
CHEK2 , RAD50 , SMC2 , and PAXIP , to predict DNA-PKcs addiction
( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S2). Intriguingly, the
therapeutic response of homologous recombination–defective
cancer cells to KU60648 seemed to be independent of TP53
mutation status ( Fig. 1A ). This observation strongly suggests
that DNA-PKcs inhibition in homologous recombination–
defective tumors might be a viable therapeutic strategy to
selectively target TP53 -defective lesions, which are typically

resistant against most fi rst-line anticancer agents, such as
chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
 To our surprise, we identifi ed MSH3 as a strong determinant
for KU60648 sensitivity, which we showed to be involved in
homologous recombination–mediated DSB repair in follow-up
experiments ( Figs. 1–4 ). There is accumulating circumstantial
evidence suggesting a role for the MSH2–MSH3 complex in
DSB repair ( 39–43 ). For instance, RNAi-mediated MSH3 depletion
has recently been shown to result in substantially delayed
RAD51 loading after 2-Gy ionizing radiation ( 25 ). Here, we
demonstrate that MSH3 mutation or defi ciency is associated
with a homologous recombination defect due to impaired
RAD51 loading ( Fig. 3 ). More importantly, we link this MSH3
defi ciency–associated homologous recombination defect to a
druggable DNA-PKcs addiction in vitro ( Fig. 2 ) and in vivo ( Fig. 5 ).
 Therapeutically Targeting the Synthetic Lethal
Interaction between MSH3 and PRKDC
 We genetically validated the synthetic lethal interaction
between MSH3 and PRKDC that emerged from our initial
screen ( Fig. 2 ). To this end, we showed that pharmacologic
DNA-PKcs inhibition in Msh3 knockout MEFs resulted in
the induction of massive apoptosis, compared with Msh3 -
profi cient isogenic control cells. Conversely, RNAi-mediated
repression of PRKDC resulted in apoptotic demise of MSH3 -
mutant cancer cells, whereas MSH3 -profi cient control cells
were largely unaffected by PRKDC knockdown ( Figs. 2 and 6 ).
 Functionally, we demonstrate that MSH3 knockout results in
substantially impaired homologous recombination–mediated
DSB repair due to delayed RAD51 loading ( Fig. 3 ). However,
MSH3 defi ciency did not completely abrogate etoposide-induced
DSB repair. In fact, MSH3 -defective cells remained capable of
repairing etoposide-induced genotoxic lesions, likely through
recruitment of alternative DSB repair pathways, such as NHEJ
( Figs. 3 and 6 ). However, pharmacologic inhibition of the essential
NHEJ kinase DNA-PKcs completely prevented etoposideinduced
DSB repair and led to the generation of ssDNA repair
intermediates, which have previously been shown to represent a
chromatin structure that triggers apoptosis ( 6 , 14 , 44 ). Moreover,
we observed early loss of S-phase for all cell lines under
KU60648 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4). However, only
KU60648-resistant cells were able to repair KU60648-induced
DNA damage and returned to normal cell-cycle profi les within
48 hours. Together, these observations mechanistically rationalized
the massive induction of apoptosis that we detected by
immunoblotting and fl ow cytometry ( Fig. 2 ).
 Clinical Perspective
 Our data reported here strongly suggest that the synthetic
lethal interaction between the NHEJ kinase DNA-PKcs
and multiple homologous recombination genes, including
BRCA1 , BRCA2 , ATM , CHEK2 , RAD50 , SMC2 and PAXIP ,
might be therapeutically exploited in patients with homologous
recombination–defective neoplastic disease. Thus, it
might be desirable to include genetically stratifi ed patient
cohorts into next-generation clinical trials with DNA-PKcs
inhibitors, such as CC-115, a dual mTOR/DNA-PKcs inhibitor,
currently being evaluated in phase I trials ( 45 ).

 Figure 6.   A simplifi ed model for DNA-PKcs addiction in homologous recombination
(HR)–defective tumors. DNA DSB repair pathways are extensively rewired in
homologous recombination–defective cancer cells to channel DNA repair toward
NHEJ. Homologous recombination–defective cells remain capable of repairing DNA
DSBs through the error-prone NHEJ pathway (top). Pharmacologic repression of
NHEJ-mediated DNA DSB repair results in a failure to resolve DSBs and leads to the
accumulation of ssDNA repair intermediates and ultimately to the apoptotic demise
of DNA-PKcs inhibitor-treated homologous recombination–defective cells.

RESEARCH ARTICLE Dietlein et al.

mutations in approximately 7% of all samples and 40% of all
hypermutated, MSI tumors ( 46 ). Thus, disabling MSH3 mutations
are present in a substantial fraction of colorectal cancer,
which represents one of the most common cancer entities in
the Western world. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
fi rst study that discovers a molecular liability in MSH3 -mutant
neoplastic disease that is amenable for pharmacologic intervention
both in vitro and in vivo . Thus, our fi ndings might have
direct therapeutic impact on the clinical care of patients suffering
from MSH3 -mutant MSI colorectal cancer. Furthermore, biopsies
retrieved from MSI colorectal cancers should be both sequenced
to determine MSH3 status and stained for RAD51 foci, after short
exposure to high-dose etoposide, to identify those patients who
are most likely to benefi t from a DNA-PKcs inhibitor therapy.

 METHODS
 Cell Lines and Reagents
 All human cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection ( www.atcc.org ) and cultured in RPMI or Dulbecco’s
Modifi ed Eagle Medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% of fetal
calf serum (FCS ) at 37°C in a humidifi ed incubator supplied with
5% CO 2 . Cell lines were authenticated by genotyping (SNP 6.0 arrays;
Affymetrix), and all cell lines were tested for infection with Mycoplasma
(MycoAlert; Lonza).
 Compounds were purchased from Axon Medchem (KU60648)
or Sigma-Aldrich (etoposide and doxorubicin), dissolved in water
or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and stored as aliquots at −80°C or
−20°C. Two independent lots were tested for each compound.
 Retroviral packaging constructs pMDg and pMDg/p were a kind gift
from T. Benzing (University Hospital, Cologne, Germany) . Plasmids
containing shRNA targeting PRKDC (V2HS 233593) were obtained
from J.B. Lazoro (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA), and
retroviral plasmids for double transduction of MEFs (pBabe–MYC and
pBabe–HRAS G12V ) were kindly provided by T. Brummelkamp (NKI-AVL,
Amsterdam, the Netherlands) . Plasmids containing shRNA targeting
KU80 (TRCN10468, TRCN18363, TRCN288701, TRCN295856, and
TRCN307986) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Viral gene delivery
was performed as described previously (50).

 Cell Line–Based Screening
 High-throughput cell line–based screening was performed as
described previously ( 47 ). In brief, cell lines were plated in triplicate
into sterile 96-well plates at 1,000 cells per well density and treated
with 10 increasing concentrations (range, 1 nmol/L–2 μmol/L) of
KU60648 for 96 hours. Relative cell viability was determined by measuring
the ATP content (CellTiter-Glo; Promega) and normalizing it
to the untreated control. Measurements were repeated if half-maximal
inhibitory concentrations (GI 50 ) of triplicates differed by more
than 10% or if the average GI 50 value was lower than 400 nmol/L.

 Genetic Compound Activity Prediction
 For the calculation of GI 50 , concentration–viability curves were
interpolated by logistic functions (R package “ic50”; ref. 48 ). For
each concentration (range, 150 nmol/L–1 μmol/L), we calculated the
distance to its nearest neighbor in the KU60648 screening activity
profi le to infer a suitable GI 50 threshold. We used this threshold to
classify cells into KU60648-sensitive and KU60648-resistant lines.
 We next annotated all cell lines for which sequencing data were available
in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia database (MAF fi les; ref. 16 )
by their protein-coding mutations. We tested for each gene whether
mutations were more frequent in the KU60648-sensitive cohort than
in the group of resistant cell lines by the Fisher exact test. In addition,

we calculated for each gene its sensitivity effect by comparing GI 50
values between mutant versus wild-type cell lines. For missense mutations,
we predicted their functional effect on global protein structure
by the PolyPhen-2 algorithm ( 49 ).
 Xenograft Mouse Models
 All animal procedures were approved by the local animal protection
committee and the local authorities. Six- to 10-week-old male
NMRI nu/nu mice (CRL:NMRI-FOXN1 NU; Charles River Laboratories)
were subcutaneously engrafted with 5 × 10 6 tumor cells (HCT116,
A549) or MYC/RAS double-transduced Msh3−/− or Msh3 wt/wt MEFs.
The DNA-PKcs inhibitor KU60648 was dissolved in PBS at a fi nal
concentration of 6 mg/mL for xenograft application.
 Upon the formation of palpable subcutaneous tumors, mice
received intraperitoneal injections of either KU60648 (40 mg/kg)
or PBS twice daily. Perpendicular tumor diameters were assessed
daily by an external caliper, and tumor volumes were calculated by
the modifi ed ellipsoid formula [ V = 1/2 (length × width 2 )]. After 7
(double-transduced MEFs) or 14 (HCT116, A549) days of therapy,
mice were sacrifi ced and subcutaneous tumors were resected and then
fi xed in 4% formalin overnight.
