Abstract Background Eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E,
an important regulator of translation, plays a crucial role in
the malignant transformation, progression and chemoresistance
of many human solid tumors. The overexpression
of this gene has been found in a variety of human malignancies
including breast carcinoma. In the present study,
we attempted to explore the possibility of eIF4E as a
therapeutic target for the treatment of human breast carcinoma
using breast carcinoma cell line (MCF-7).
Materials and methods The survivin promoter-driven
eIF4E-shRNA vector was constructed on the basis of
pSUPER.retro vector. Then, we established stably transfected
MCF-7 and MCF210 (normal human mammary
epithelial cell) cells expressing eIF4E-shRNAs or controlshRNAs.
Firstly, the changes of eIF4E expression were
detected by RT-PCR and Western blot assays. Next, the
optimal shRNA vector (eIF4E-shRNA2) was selected to
knock down eIF4E expression and investigate the effect of
eIF4E-shRNA on eIF4E-regulated gene expression and cell
proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Followingly, the
changes of cell cycle and apoptosis in the stably transfectants
(MCF-7) were detected by flow cytometry and
TUNEL methods, while we also explored possible

apoptosis pathways. Finally, we investigated the effect of
shRNA targeting eIF4E on the chemosensitivity of breast
carcinoma cells to cisplatin in vitro and in vivo. Results
Two survivin promoter-driven eIF4E-shRNA vectors were
successfully constructed. eIF4E-shRNA2 but not eIF4EshRNA1
efficiently downregulated the levels of eIF4E
expression in the stably transfected MCF-7-s2 cells but not
in the stably transfected MCF210-s2 cells, while MCF-7-s2
showed obvious proliferation suppression but MCF210-s2
did not. The downregulation of eIF4E expression significantly
reduced the levels of VEGF, FGF-2 and cyclinD1
expression, suppressed cell growth, induced cell cycle
arrest in G0/G1 phase and subsequent apoptosis by activating
caspase 3 in MCF-7 cells. The results of FCM and
TUNEL staining assays indicated that the classic apoptosis
characters of the MCF-7 cells stably expressing eIF4EshRNA2
manifested an apoptosis rate of 18.3%, significantly
higher than those in the control groups (P\0.05).
Morever, we found that downregulation of c-IAP1, c-IAP2
and c-Myc but not Bcl-2 family proteins were involved in
the apoptosis induced by eIF4E-shRNA2. In tumorigenicity
assay, xenograft tumors developed from MCF-7-s2 cells
in mice showed a significant slowdown in the growth speed
and formation rate compared with control groups. Furthermore,
we also testified that eIF4E-shRNA could
synergistically enhance the cytotoxicity effects of cisplatin
to MCF-7 cells both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion
Survivin promoter–driven RNA interference system could
efficiently and specifically downregulate eIF4E expression
in human breast carcinoma cells but not in normal human
mammary epithelial cell cells. Thus, eIF4E might play an
important role in chemosensitivity to cisplatin, and survivin
promoter-driven RNAi targeting eIF4E can be used as
adjuvant therapy for human breast carcinomas with tumor
specificity and high efficacy.

Introduction

Breast carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies
affecting women around the world and one in seven
women is predicted to develop invasive breast cancer
during their lifetime [1]. Conventional chemotherapy regimens
for the treatment of breast carcinoma have limited
efficacy for their significant toxicity in the body [2]. To
improve its horrible prognosis, we need to better understand
the mechanism of breast carcinoma development and
to find novel approaches to both diagnosis and treatment
that are far more efficient than currently available techniques
[3]. Thus, an understanding of the molecular
mechanisms involved in breast carcinoma formation and
progression would be helpful to develop more effective
treatments for breast carcinoma.
Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is a 25-kDa cap
binding protein that plays an important role in the initiation
of protein translation. It is the limiting component of a
complex including several members of the eIF4 group of
eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factors, which usually
regulates cap-dependent protein synthesis by binding
to the m7GpppX cap of mRNA and regulating the
recruitment of mRNA to ribosomes [4–7]. The most frequently
aberrant change in the translational apparatus is the
upregulated levels of eIF4E expression, which selectively
affects transport of specific transcripts, increases capdependent
translation, suppresses apoptosis and induces
malignant transformation [8–10]. Several research groups
have reported that the overexpression of eIF4E gene is
associated with tumor angiogenesis in breast cancer and the
degree of eIF4E overexpression predicts cancer recurrence
and outcome in stage I to III breast cancer patients [11, 12].
Morever, the eIF4E overexpression has been found in
many other types of human malignancies, such as head and
neck squamous carcinoma, colon carcinoma, bladder carcinoma,
cervix carcinoma and lung cancer, suggesting that
the upregulated level of eIF4E expression is associated
with malignant transformation, tumorigenesis and metastasis
of tumors [13–17]. It also has been reported that the
upregulated levels of eIF4E expression greatly increase
translation of some mRNAs encoding proteins contributing
to angiogenesis and proliferation such as vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth
factor (FGF-2) and cyclin D1 [18, 19]. VEGF and FGF-2
are considered to be two important stimulators of migration
and angiogenesis, which are related to the progression and
metastasis of breast carcinoma. Additionally, the elevated
level of cyclin D1 expression has been found to be

involved in cisplatin chemoresistance of many tumor cells,
including breast cancer [20]. Therefore, we hypothesized
that eIF4E would be a good molecular target for breast
carcinoma therapy. Other researchers reported that antisense
or small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting eIF4E or
cyclin D1 could suppress oncogenic properties and enhance
chemosensitivity to cisplatin in head and neck carcinoma
cells [21, 22], but the use of this target via downregulating
eIF4E expression in the treatment of human cancers still
needs to find a method with high efficacy and tumor
specificity, which can effectively inhibit eIF4E gene
expression in tumor cells but can not affect the eIF4E
activity in normal cells.
RNA interference (RNAi) is a post-transcriptional
mechanism of gene silencing through chromatin remodeling,
inhibition of protein translation or direct mRNA
degradation. This technology is currently the most widely
utilized technique in functional genomic studies and therapeutic
gene regulation [23]. Specific gene silencing can be
achieved in a variety of cell systems using an in vitro
synthesized small interfering RNA (siRNA) or DNA vector-based
shRNA [24]. siRNA-mediated silencing effect is
transient, but DNA vector-based shRNA could achieve a
stable supply of anti-cancer siRNA for gene therapy. To
achieve a tumor-specific silencing of targeted gene, we
explored the possibility of a tumor-specific promoter to
drive shRNA expression. Survivin, a novel member of the
inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) protein family, is highly
active in human cancers but is inactive in most somatic
cells [25]. Recently, the survivin gene has been cloned by
several independent groups and it has been found to be
expressed at high levels in primary tumors and cancer cell
lines but repressed in most somatic tissues [26]. The promoter
of the suvivin gene has been subcloned by us,
recently [27]. Deletion analysis of the survivin promoter
identified a core promoter region of *980 bp upstream of
the transcription start site. Transient expression assays
revealed that the core promoter is significantly activated in
tumor cells but is repressed in normal primary cells [28].
Thus, we want to address whether the survivin promoter
may be used for tumor-specific gene silencing.
In the present report, we initially developed a novel
tumor-specific RNAi system targeting eIF4E directly under
the control of survivin promoter. Followingly, we performed
Western blot analysis on a panel of four human
breast carcinoma cell lines, revealing eIF4E overexpression
in all four breast carcinoma cells in comparison with normal
human mammary epithelial cell line, MCF210.
Furthermore, we established stably transfectants (eIF4EshRNA2)
which displayed minimal levels of eIF4E
expression in MCF-7 cells but showed no obvious changes
in MCF210 cells. In those stably transfected MCF-7-s2
cells, we detected the reduced expression of growth-related

444 Breast Cancer Res Treat (2009) 113:443–456

123
genes such as VEGF, bFGF and cyclinD1, while we also
observed that those stably transfected cells showed a significant
enhancement in chemosensitivity to cisplatin
besides a marked proliferation inhibition and apoptosis
induction. Taken together, all these experimental data
provided evidences of the potential use of survivin promoter-driven
RNAi targeting eIF4E as adjuvant therapy for
human breast carcinoma.

Materials and methods

Cell lines and culture conditions

A normal human mammary epithelial cell line (MCF210)
and four human breast cancer cells (T47D, Bcap37,
SKBR-3, MCF-7) were purchased from Cell Culture
Center, Fourth Military Medicine University. All cells
were cultured in RPIM-1640 medium (Gibico, USA)
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin–streptomycin.
All cell lines were maintained at
37C
with 5% CO2.

Plasmids construction

The pSUPER.retro vector was provided from OligoEngine
(Seattle, WA, USA). The survivin promoter gene (GenBank
NM U75285) including 980 bp upstream from the transcription
initiation site was amplified from our previously
obtained survivin promoter plasmid by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR). The PCR product was then subcoloned
into the BglII and EcoRI site of pSUPER.retro vector to
replace H1-RNA promoter. A minimal poly (A) sequence
(50
-TTATTTCCTAGAAAATAAAAGTAACCTAGACACAC
AACCAAAAAACATACGCCGGCGA-30
) was used as a
terminal sequence. DNA template oligonucleotides corresponding
to eIF4E gene (GenBank NM BC035166) 1711–
1729 bp and 2021–2039 bp were designed and synthesized
as follows: eIF4E–shRNA1 (sense, 50
-GATCCGCG
GCTGATCTCCAAGTTTTTCAAGAGAAAACTTGGAGAT
CAGCCGCAGA-30
), eIF4E-shRNA2 (sense, 50
-GATCT
GCAATATGGACTACGAATGTTCAAGAGACATTCGTAG
TCCATATTGCAGA-30
) and a non-specific shRNA, NS
(sense, 50
-GATCTAAGCATTAGGTACAGCATTTCAAGA
GAATGCTGTACCTAATGCTTAGA-30
). All of the above
sequences were inserted into the BglII and HindIII enzyme
sites of pSUPER.retro vector, respectively. Those recombinant
plasmids were named pSUPER-SP-eIF4EshRNA1,
pSUPER-SP-eIF4EshRNA2, and pSUPER-SP-NS vector,
respectively (Fig. 1). Those recombinant vectors were
confirmed by the digestion analysis of restriction endonuclease
and all inserted sequences were verified by DNA
sequencing.

Transfection and selection of stable transfectants

Human breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7) and normal human
mammary epithelial cells (MCF210) were seeded at 70–
80% confluence in 6-well plates, respectively. Then, the
cells were transfected with those recombinant pSUPER
vectors containing a puromycin selection marker using
LipofectAMINE Plus (Grand Island, NY) according to the
manufacturer’s protocols and were selected with 8 lg/ml
of puromycin (Sigma, USA) for 14 days. Single clones
were isolated and expanded for an additional two months in
media containing 3lg/ml of puromycin. Name of stable
transfectants were MCF-7-s1 or MCF210-s1(transfected
with pSUPER-SP-eIF4EshRNA1), MCF-7-s2 or MCF210-
s2 (transfected with pSUPER-SP-eIF4EshRNA2), MCF-7-
NS or MCF210-NS (transfected with pSUPER-SP-NS),
and MCF-7-pS.retro or MCF210-pS.retro (transfected with
parental vector pSUPER.retro), respectively.

RT-PCR for eIF4E mRNA

Total RNA was extracted from untransfected or stably
transfected MCF-7 cells and MCF210 cells using TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen, USA), respectively. RNA of 2 ll
(1 lg/ll) was used to synthesize cDNA using Superscript
First-Strand Synthesis Kit (Promega, USA) following the
manufacturer’s protocols. The cDNA was used to amplify
the eIF4E gene, while the house keeping gene b-actin was
also amplified as an internal standard. The corresponding
primer sequences were as follows: eIF4E, forward: 50
-ATG
GCGACTGTCGAACCGG-30
, reverse: 50
-GCTATCTTAT
CACCTTTAGC-30
; b-actin, forward: 50
-AGCAACCGGGAG
CTGGTGG-30
, reverse: 50
-CATTTCCGACTGAAGAGTG30.
The cycling program was performed as follows: 1cycle
of 94C
for 3 min; 35 cycles of 94C
for 40 s, 60C
for
40 s, 72C
for 90 s; followed by a final elongation step of
72C
for 10 min. Then, RT-PCR products were electrophoresed
through a 1.5% agarose gel with ethidium
bromide. Signals were quantified by densitometric analysis
using the Labworks Image Acquisition (UVP, Inc., Upland,
CA). The inhibitory rate of eIF4E mRNA expression was
calculated as follows: inhibitory rate = [1 - (MCF-7-s1
or s2 eIF4E density/MCF-7-s1 or s2 b-actin density)/
(MCF-7 eIF4E density/MCF-7 b-actin density)] 9 100%.

Western blot analysis

Western blot analysis was performed using a previously
described procedure [29]. Those untransfected and stably
transfected MCF-7 or MCF210 cells were collected and
lysed (50 mmol/l of Tris–HCl, 150 mmol/l of NaCl,
50 mmol/l of EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.5 mmol/l of PMSF, and
2 mg/ml of pepstatin A) on ice, respectively. Anti-eIF4E,

anti-survivin, anti-VEGF, anti-FGF-2, anti-cyclinD1, anticleaved
caspase 3, anti-c-IAP1, anti-c-IAP2, anti-c-Myc,
anti-Bcl-2, anti-Bcl-xl, anti-Bad, anti-pBad and anti-actin
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) antibodies were used for
Western blot assay. Signals were detected by enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham). The levels of eIF4E
protein expression were determined densitometrically and
normalized to b-actin. The inhibitory rate of eIF4E protein
expression was calculated according to above mentioned
formula. The cells that had higher inhibitory rate of eIF4E
expression were harvested and used for further assays.

In vitro cell proliferation assay

Cell viability was measured by a 3-(4,5-dimethythazolz-yl)-
2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Four kinds
of MCF-7 and MCF210 cells (cells without transfection,
cells stably transfected with parental vector, non-specific
shRNA or eIF4E–shRNA2), at 1.0 9 104 per well, were
seeded into seven 96-well culture plates, with each plate
having all four kinds of cells and each group consisted of 12
parallel wells. Every day, we selected one plate from those
plates at random for MTT assay. Every well was added 10 ll
MTT(5 mg/ml) to each well, incubated for 4 h, 100 ll
DMSO was added, and lysed for 15 min. After 24-h cultivation,
optical densities of one of seven culture plates were
determined on a microreader (Bio-Rad Co.) at 490 nm. The
inhibitory rate of cell growth was calculated as: inhibitory
rate = (1 - Atreated group/Auntreated group) 9 100%. All
experiments were performed three times independently.

In vitro colony formation assay

For the colony formation assay, approximately 1.0 9 103
untransfected or stably transfected MCF-7 or MCF-210

cells were plated in 10-cm culture dishes, respectively.
During this period, we fed them every 2–3 days with
complete medium. After 18-day incubation, cells were
fixed with methanol and stained with 0.1% crystal violet.
Visible colonies were manually counted. All experiments
were performed in triplicate.

Analysis of cell cycle

Approximately 1.0 9 104 cells of each group (untransfected
and stably transfected MCF-7 cells) were seeded into 100 ml
flasks and incubated until there was 80–85% confluence in
complete medium. Then, the cells were harvested, washed
with ice-colded PBS twice, fixed with 70% ethanol overnight
at 4C,
washed and resuspended in 100 ml of PBS containing
final concentrations of 50 mg/ml RNase A for 30 min at
room temperature. Finally, the fixed cells stained with propidium
iodide (PI). PI-stained cells were analyzed by EPICSELITE-ESP
Flow Cytometry (Coulter Biosciences). All of
the samples were assayed three times, and the fraction of cell
cycle distribution was calculated.

Flow cytometry for analysis of apoptotic cells

The untransfected or stably transfected MCF-7 cells were
harvested, washed with ice-colded PBS twice, and
resuspended in binding buffer (10 mM of Hepes, pH 7.4,
150 mM of NaCl, 2.5 mM of CaCl2, 1 mM of MgCl2, 4%
bovine serum albumin). Using Annexin V-fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC) apoptosis detection kit (Oncogene
Research Products, Boston, MA), cells were stained with
Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium
iodide following the manufacturer’s protocols. After a
15-min incubation in the dark at room temperature,
stained cells were immediately analyzed on an Epics
XL-MCL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, USA). All of

enzyme sites downstream of the survivin promoter and PolyA as a

termination signal. The predicted secondary structure of the pSUPERSP-shRNA
targeting eIF4E is shown. The transcript, a short hairpin

123
the samples were assayed in triplicate, and the cell
apoptosis rate calculated using the following formula:
apoptosis rate = (Napoptotic cell/Ntotal cell) 9 100%.

TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay

MCF-7 cells stably transfected with siRNA duplex for 48 h,
and then with adriamycin for 24 h; the effects on cell
apoptosis were examined by TUNEL assay. Cells were fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4), then stained and analyzed
for apoptosis using an In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit,
Fluorescein (Nanjing Keygen Biotech. Co., Ltd). Fixed cells
were permeabilized using a mixture containing 0.1% sodium
citrate and 0.1% TritonX100 and then incubated with
TUNEL reaction mixture containing terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase
and fluorescein-dUTP at 37C
for 60 min.

Measurement of caspase-3 activity

Caspase-3 activity was measured using caspase colorimetric
assay kit (Sigma, USA), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, cells were scraped
into PBS, pelleted at low speed, and resuspended in lysis
buffer for 10 min at 4C.
Cell lysates were cleared by
concentration and assayed for caspase-3 activity using a
DEVDpNA peptide substrate and incubated for 6 h at
37C.
The activities were quantified spectrophotometrically
at a wavelength of 405 nm. Caspase activity was
calculated as the change in absorbance at 405 nm and
divided by total protein concentration.

Murine Xenograft Model for tumorigenicity assay

The effect of eIF4E on tumorigenicity was assessed by
subcutaneous injection of stably transfected MCF-7 cells
into athymic nude mice. Each aliquot of 5.0 9 106 cells
was injected into the back of BALB/c nude mice (Nu/Nu,
female, 6–7 weeks old), which were maintained under
pathogen-free conditions. The formation of subcutaneous
tumors was monitored and measured with a digital caliper.
The tumor volume formed was calculated by the following
formula: V = 0.4 9 D 9 d2 (V, volume; D, longitudinal
diameter; d, latitudinal diameter). At 42 days after inoculation,
all mice were sacrificed, and s.c tumors were
resected and fixed in 10%PBS. Animal experiments in this
study were carried out in accordance with medicine institutional
guidelines of Fourth Military Medical University.

In vitro chemosensitivity assay

In vitro, MCF-7 cell chemosensitivity to cisplatin (Sigma,
USA) was evaluated by MTT analysis and apoptosis

detection assay. Firstly, the IC50 of cisplatin to MCF-7 cells
was examined by MTT assay according to the previously
described methods. Then, the untransfected or stably
transfected MCF-7 cells in the 96-wells were treated with
various concentrations of cisplatin at 0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 16.0,
and 32.0lg/ml, respectively. After 48-h incubation, the cell
viability and cell apoptosis was detected according to
methods described above. The cell survival value
index was calculated as: Survivial index = [A490(5-FU+) /
A490(5-FU-)] 9 100%

In vivo chemosensitivity to cisplatin in nude mice

Xenograft tumors were developed as above. In brief, suspensions
of 2.0 9 106 cells (MCF-7-NS and MCF-7-s2) in
N.S (50 ll) were injected s.c. in to the back of BALB/c
nude mice (Nu/Nu, female, 6–7 weeks old) at day 0. The
inoculation was conducted in mice (10/group), and mice
were treated with cisplatin (5.0 mg/kg; thrice weekly) or
with 0.1 ml N.S (PH 7.4; thrice weekly) as described
previously with modifications. Tumor growth was calculated
from the average volume of tumors, and tumor
volume was calculated as already described. At 35 days
after inoculation, all mice were sacrificed, and s.c tumors
were resected and fixed in 10%PBS. Animal experiments
in this study were carried out in accordance with medicine
institutional guidelines of Fourth Military Medical
University.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS statistical
software. Student’s t-test and one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison
tests were adopted. Values of P\0.05 were considered as
significant and indicated by asterisks in the figures.

Results

The eIF4E and survivin expression in a panel of breast
carcinoma cells and a normal mammary epithelial cell
line

The levels of eIF4E and survivin expression in breast
cancer cell lines were determined by comparing the levels
of survivin protein and eIF4E protein in a panel of human
breast carcinoma cells (T47 D, Bcap37, SKBR-3, MCF-7)
to that in a normal mammary epithelial cell (MCF210) by
Western blot analysis. After normalization to b-actin, the
levels of eIF4E protein expression in the breast cancer cell
lines varied from 3.5-fold (T47D) to 6.5-fold (MCF-7).

Breast Cancer Res Treat (2009) 113:443–456 447

123
These values were obtained by comparing the normalized
level of eIF4E in MCF210 cells to that of eIF4E in other
breast carcinoma cells (Fig. 2). Considering higher levels
of eIF4E expression in MCF-7 cells, so we selected MCF-7
cell line for following assays. We also detected the levels
of survivin protein expression in those cells, as shown in
Fig. 2, survivin was expressed at high levels in four breast
carcinoma cells but not detected in normal mammary
epithelial cell. All these data provided a basis for the
survivin promoter-driven shRNA to silence eIF4E gene
in breast carcinoma with tumor specificity and high
efficacy.

Tumor-specific downregulation of eIF4E expression by
survivin promoter-driven shRNA

To exclude off-target silencing effect mediated by specific-shRNA,
we employed two different sequences of
eIF4E-shRNAs in the present study. In order to evaluate
the downregulation of eIF4E mRNA and protein expression,
RT-PCR and Western blot analyses were performed.
As shown in Fig. 3, the levels of eIF4E mRNA and
protein expression in the MCF-7-s2 cells were significantly
reduced in comparison with those in the
untransfected MCF-7 cells, and the inhibitory rates were
68.5% and 59.6% (P\0.05), respectively; However, the
levels of eIF4E mRNA and protein expression in MCF7-s1,
MCF-7-NS and MCF-7-pS.retro cells showed no
obvious difference (P[0.05). In addition, we observed
that there was no difference among MCF210-s1,
MCF210-s2, MCF210-NS, MCF210-pS.retro and
untransfected MCF210 cells (P[0.05, Fig. 4). Morever,
no effects of RNAi were observed on the expression of
b-actin used as an internal control. All these results
indicated that the survivin promoter–driven RNA interference
system could specifically downregulate eIF4E
expression in breast carcinoma cells but not in normal
mammary epithelial cells. Followingly, we chose pSUPER-SP-eIF4EshRNA2
for further assays.

Effects of eIF4E-shRNA on expression of other eIF4Eregulated
genes

It has been reported that the overexpression of eIF4E gene
might induce the upregulated expression of angiogenesis
and growth-related genes such as vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2)
and cyclinD1. Thus, we want to determine the effects of
specific-shRNA targeting eIF4E on the levels of these
proteins. As shown in Fig. 5, when compared to untransfected
MCF-7 cells, the expression of VEGF, four FGF-2
isoforms and cyclinD1 proteins in the eIF4E-downregulated
MCF-7-s2 cells significantly decreased by 73.4%,
58.6% and 83.8%, respectively (P\0.05). However, there
was no difference in the protein expression level among
MCF-7, MCF-7-pS.retro and MCF-7-NS cells (P[0.05).

eIF4E-shRNA significantly and specifically inhibited
in vitro cell growth

In order to determine the phenotypical changes, we first
investigated the effect of RNAi-mediated downregulation of
eIF4E expression on MCF-7 and MCF210 cells proliferation
in vitro. In this experiment, cellular proliferation was monitored
by MTT assay daily for 7 days. The cell growth curve
showed that compared with untransfected MCF-7 cells,
MCF-7-s2 cell proliferation was significantly inhibited in a

Fig. 2 Western blot analysis comparing eIF4E and survivin expression
in various human breast carcinoma cells to MCF210, a normal
mammary epithelial cell. The levels of eIF4E protein expression in
four tumor cell lines varied from 3.5-fold (T47D) to 6.5-fold (MCF-7)
compared to that in normal mammary cells. The high-level expression
of survivin protein was detected in four tumor cell lines but not in
normal cells. b-actin was used to normalize for any differences in
protein loading between lanes

Fig. 3 (a) eIF4E mRNA and protein expression in MCF-7 cells
detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and (b) Western blot analysis.
When compared to untransfected MCF-7 cells, the eIF4E mRNA and
protein expression in MCF-7-s2 obviously reduced by 68.5% and
59.6%, respectively (P\0.05), but the eIF4E mRNA and protein
expression in MCF-7-pS.retro, MCF-7-NS and MCF-7-s1 cells
showed no difference (P[0.05). b-actin was considered as an
internal normalization standard. Marker: DL2000

time-dependent manner and the highest inhibitory rate was
48.2 ± 1.6% on day 7 (F = 873.216, P\0.01), while MCF7-NS
and MCF-7-pS.retro cells showed no obvious proliferation
inhibition (P[0.05; Fig. 6a). In those MCF210 cell
models, we found that eIF4E-shRNA2 could not induce proliferation
inhibition in MCF210-s2 cells (P[0.05; Fig. 6b).
All these further testified the tumor specificity of survivin
promoter–driven RNA interference system.

eIF4E-shRNA showed obviously reduced colony
formation potential in vitro

To investigate whether the potential of shRNA targeting
eIF4E mentioned above might result in suppression of
tumor cell colony formation in vitro, we plated untransfected
or stably transfected MCF-7 and MCF210 cells
in vitro, respectively. Colony formation assay was assayed
18 days after plated. The mean values ± SD from three
determinations are shown in Fig. 7. As expected from the
results of MTT assay, the colony numbers obtained from
MCF-7-s2 cells (averaged number = 342) were much
lower than those obtained from MCF-7-NS, MCF-7-
pS.retro and MCF-7 cells (averaged number = 788, 776
and 812; P\0.05, Fig. 7a). However, as shown in Fig. 7b,
there were no obvious differences among colony numbers
obtained from MCF210, MCF210-pS.retro, MCF210-NS,

protein expression in MCF-7 cells. The stably transfected MCF-7
cells were harvested and analyzed for the expression of VEGF, FGF-2
and cyclinD1 by Western blot analysis. The same blots were reacted
with anti-b-actin antibody as loading control. When compared to
untransfected MCF-7 cells, the expression of VEGF, FGF-2 and
cyclinD1 proteins in MCF-7-s2 significantly decreased by 73.4%,
58.6% and 83.8%, respectively (P\0.05), but the levels of those
proteins expression in MCF-7-pS.retro and MCF-7-NS cells showed
no significant difference (P[0.05)

The eIF4E mRNA and protein expression showed no obvious
difference among MCF210, MCF210-pS.retro, MCF210-NS,
MCF210-s1 and MCF210-s2 cells. The results showed that survivin
promoter-driven shRNA targeting eIF4E had no effect on the eIF4E
mRNA and protein expression in normal MCF210 cells. b-actin was
considered as an internal normalization standard. Marker: DL2000

The cell proliferation of untransfected or stably transfected MCF-7
and MCF210 cells was measured by MTT assay. (a) The cell
proliferation of MCF-7-s2 was obviously inhibited in a timedependent
manner, and the highest inhibitory rate was 48.2 ± 1.6%
on day 7 (F = 873.216, P\0.01); (b) The cell proliferation of
MCF210-s2 (the highest inhibitory = 8.65% on day 7) showed no
obvious changes compared to control cells (F = 26.835, P [0.05).

and MCF210-s2 cells (averaged number = 886, 902, 874
and 856; P[0.05).

The effect of eIF4E-shRNA on the cell cycle of MCF-7
cells

To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the siRNAmediated
growth inhibition, we performed cell cycle
analysis to examine the effects of eIF4E-shRNA on the
cell cycle of MCF-7 cells and each assay was performed
three times. The mean values of triplicate experiments
were shown in Fig. 8. Compared with that of untransfected
MCF-7, MCF-7-pS.retro and MCF-7-NS cells, the
percentage of MCF-7-s2 cells in the G1/G0 phase obviously
increased by 14.7 ± 1.1%, while the percentage of
MCF-7-s2 cells in S phase significantly reduced by
13.2 ± 1.6% (P\0.05).

Enhancing apoptosis of MCF-7 cells by eIF4E-shRNA

We hypothesized that the growth suppression of MCF-7
cells by RNAi-mediated downregulation of eIF4E

expression was caused by apoptotic cell death. In order to
explore this possibility, we measured levels of apoptosis in
stably transfected MCF-7 cells and control MCF-7 cells
using various apoptosis detection assays. Firstly, cell
apoptosis detected by flow cytometry showed that the
apoptosis rate of MCF-7-s2 significantly increased to
18.3 ± 1.7% (P\0.05), while there were no differences
in cell apoptosis among MCF-7, MCF-7-pS.retro and
MCF-7-NS cells (2.4%, 3.2% and 4.6%; P[0.05,
Fig. 9a), which was 3.8 ± 0.6%, 4.2 ± 1.0% and
5.2 ± 0.7%, respectively. Secondly, the TUNEL assay for
detection of apoptosis at a single cell level, based on
labeling of DNA strand breaks, was performed. Results
from analysis of the TUNEL assay revealed that eIF4EshRNA
treatments increased apoptosis of these cells
because the majority of MCF-7-s2 cells showed intense
brown staining when compared to the control cells
(Fig. 9b).

The effect of eIF4E-shRNA on the activation of
apoptotic pathways

To determine further insight into the mechanism of
eIF4E-shRNA2-induced apoptosis, we first investigated

Fig. 8 Effects of eIF4E-shRNA on the cell cycle progression. The
MCF-7-s2 and other control cells were fixed, stained and analyzed for
PI fluorescence intensity by flow cytometry. Cell cycle distributions
of the control and shRNA-transfected cells were determined from the
flow cytometry data. It was shown that the percentage of MCF-7-s2
cells (G1/G0 phase) increased by 14.7 ± 1.1%, while the percentage
of MCF-7-s2 cells (S phase) reduced by 13.2 ± 1.6% (P\0.05)

cells were seeded onto six-well culture plates at a concentration of
3.0 9 102 cells/well and cultured for 17 days. The means ± SD of
colony number was counted in three different wells at 18 days after
seeded, and the averaged number was plotted. The number of colonies
in the MCF-7-s2 cell group (averaged colony number = 342) was
significantly reduced (P\0.05) compared with that seen in the other
cell groups. The experiments were repeated thrice and similar results
were obtained. Representative data are shown, * P\0.05

the involvement of caspase-3. We used anti-cleaved caspase
3 antibodies to perform Western blot analysis and
detected caspase 3 activity on untransfected or stably
transfected cells (MCF-7, MCF-7-pS.retro, MCF-7-NS
and MCF-7-s2). As shown in Fig. 10a, b, the activation of
caspase 3 could be observed and the caspase-3 activity
increased by 221% in MCF-7-s2 cells. Followingly, in
order to confirm that the activation of caspases culminates
in the apoptosis of MCF-7 cells, we employed the MTT
assay to detect the cell viability of MCF-7-s2 cells or the
cell viability of MCF-7-s2 treated with a pancaspase
inhibitor. We observed that a pancaspase inhibitor could
partially restore the cell viability of MCF-7-s2 cells,
confirming that the cell death of MCF-7 cells induced by
eIF4E-shRNA2 was a caspase-dependent process
(Fig. 10c). Next, Western blot analysis was performed to
determine whether the levels of the antiapoptotic proteins
(c-IAP1, c-IAP2, c-Myc, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl) and the proapoptotic
proteins (Bad and phosphorylated BadSer136)
were altered in the presence of eIF4E-shRNA2. MCF-7-s2
cells stably expressing eIF4E-shRNA2 had a significant
reduction in the levels of c-IAP1 c-IAP2 and c-Myc but
not Bcl-2 family proteins as compared with controls
(Fig. 10d). These results showed that downregulation of
c-IAP1, c-IAP2 and c-Myc but not Bcl-2 family proteins
were involved in the apoptosis induced by eIF4EshRNA2.Downregulation
of eIF4E in the MCF-7 cells retards
tumorigenicity in nude mice

In order to confirm inhibition of eIF4E expression by
shRNA treatment, tumor homogenates were subjected to
Western blot analysis for eIF4E. Mean eIF4E expression in
tumors formed from MCF-7-s2 cells was 64.5% lower than
those in tumors formed from other control cells (Fig. 11a).
To explore the possible effect of eIF4E-shRNA2 on tumor
growth in vivo, s.c. tumor formation assay in nude mice
was performed. As shown in Fig. 11b, the xenografts
developed from MCF-7-s2 cells at 42 days (averaged
size = 233.5 mm3
) were significantly smaller than the
xenografts developed from MCF-7, MCF-7-pS.retro, and
MCF-7-NS cells (averaged size = 413.7, 434.5 and
397.7 mm3
). All these experimental data showed that
RNAi-mediated downregulation of eIF4E expression
exerted a potent growth inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells
in vivo.

The specific downregulation of eIF4E expression
enhances cisplatin cytotoxicity in vitro

Other reports have shown that the overexpression of cyclinD1
induced chemoresistance of human solid tumors to
cisplatin. Our previous and others studies also showed that
the upregulated levels of cyclinD1 expression are

cells. (I) The apoptotic rate of MCF-7 cells was detected by flow
cytometry. The FCM results showed that the apoptotic rate of MCFs2
obviously increased by 18.3 ± 1.7% (P\0.05); while there were
no obvious differences in cell apoptosis among MCF-7-pS.retro,
MCF-7-NS and untransfected MCF-7 cells (3.2%, 4.6% and 2.4%;

P[0.05). (II) TUNEL assay was performed to detect apoptotic cells.
Compared to control cells, MCF-7-s2 cells showed an increasing dark
brown-positive signal located in nucleus. It was shown that apoptotic
rate of the eIF4E-downreglated MCF-7 cells was significantly higher
than the controls. (a) MCF-7; (b) MCF-7-pS.retro; (c) MCF-7-NS; (d)

associated with the overexpression of eIF4E gene, so we
next explored whether the shRNA-mediated downregulation
of eIF4E expression could affect the sensitivity of
MCF-7 cells to the antitumor agent cisplatin. Firstly, we
sought to determine the effect of eIF4E knockdown on the
cisplatin IC50 of breast carcinoma cells in vitro. The stably
transfected or untransfected MCF-7 cells were plated into
96-well trays and exposed to 0–15 lg/ml cisplatin for a
further 48 h. IC50 (12.3 lg/ml) was determined by MTT
assay (data not shown). Compared with control cells, the
cisplatin IC50 significantly decreased by 61.1% in MCF7-s2
cells (Fig. 12a). As shown in Fig. 12b, we observed
that the survival index in MCF-7-s2 cells was obviously
decreased with the addition of 4.0 * 32.0 lg/ml cisplatin
compared with controls (P\0.05). Furthermore, following
cisplatin treatment, the apoptotic fraction of MCF-7-s2
cells markedly increased in comparison with that of control
cells (Fig. 12c).

The effect of eIF4E downregulation on
chemosensitivity to cisplatin in vivo

In view of these findings in vitro, we wanted to test the
efficacy of eIF4E-shRNA2 as an in vivo chemosensitizing

strategy in a nude mouse xenograft model. To explore the
possible effect of eIF4E downregulation on chemosensitivity
to cisplatin in vivo, s.c tumors (MCF-7-NS or MCF7-s2)
were formed in nude mice followed by treatment with
cisplatin or N.S. After the treatment with cisplatin, the
proliferation of tumors developed from MCF-7-s2 cells
was significantly inhibited compared with that of those
developed from MCF-7-NS cells (Fig. 13a). At 35 days
after inoculation, we monitored tumor size as described
above. Following 5 weeks of treatment with cisplatin or
N.S, the average tumor size of tumor developed from
MCF-7-s2 and MCF-7-NS was 134.5 mm3 and 208.9 mm3
,
respectively (Fig. 13b). The RNAi-mediated downregulation
of eIF4E expression led to a 35.6% suppression of
tumor proliferation. Hence, eIF4E-shRNA2 along with
chemotherapeutic cisplatin could produce a synergistic
cytotoxicity effect on the cell proliferation of breast carcinoma
in vivo.

Dysregulation of translation is critical to malignant transformation
and development [30]. Eukaryotic initiation

factor 4E (eIF4E) is the rate-limiting factor in cap-dependent
translation, and its bioavailability is strictly controlled
through its association with eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1).
The overexpression of eIF4E gene has been reported
to induce the upregulation of cyclin D1 [31], a potent cell
cycle regulator as well as VEGF and FGF-2, two angiogenic
factors associated with tumor progression, invasion
and metastasis [32, 33]. The eIF4E gene has been shown to
be overexpressed in breast carcinoma but not in benign
breast tissue from noncancer patients [11]. Morever, the
degree of eIF4E overexpression appears be important and
can predict cancer recurrence in stage I to III breast carcinoma
patient. Cisplatin, a chemotherapeutic drug that
was thought to form inter- and intra-strand DNA crosslinks,
has been used as first-line therapy to treat breast
carcinoma, but its activity is far from satisfactory [34].
Thus, in order to improve the prognosis of patients with
type of refractory cancer, it is necessary to identify and
target gene conductive to the treatment of breast carcinoma,
such as enhancement of conventional chemotherapy.
Chemosensitivity to cisplatin in human cancer cells has
been reported to associate with the levels of cyclin D1
expression and inhibiting cyclin D1 expression could
markedly decrease multiple chemoresistance of tumor cells
[35]. Truely, the upregulated levels of cyclinD1 expression

in many human cancers are related to the overexpression of
eIF4E gene, so we hypothesized that reducing eIF4E
expression would downregulate cyclinD1 expression and
enhance chemosensitivity of cancer cells to cisplatin.
Therefore, in an attempt to prove its possibility and
determine the potential of eIF4E as a therapeutic target, we
employed DNA vector-based shRNA technique to downregulate
its expression and analyzed its phenotypical
changes in MCF-7 cells.
Presently, the most commonly used plasmids for
expressing shRNAs in cells contain CMV promoter and
RNA polymerase-III-based promoters, including the U6
and H1-RNA promoters [36–38]. These promoters synthesize
shRNA and elicit RNAi efficiently, but they have a
major limitation: inhibition cannot be controlled in a

tissue-specific or cell-specific manner, because the CMV
promoter and RNA Pol III promoters are constitutively
expressed in all cell types. Thus, the use of these promoters
to drive shRNA expression in vivo would silence a given
gene in all cell types, and thus produce undesirable effect
in non-target cells. Recently, a Pol II promoter-based
shRNA construct has been reported as an alternate method
to drive shRNA expression. Since some Pol II promoters
possess cell- or tissue-specific property, and they can provide
an attractive strategy for targeted gene silence in gene
therapy to decrease the probability of off-target silencing
and cellular toxicity [39]. Survivin promoter belongs to Pol
II promoter and displays high activity in human cancer
cells but not in differentiated cells. Our previous and some
of others’ reports have shown that survivin promoter
employed to drive therapeutic genes could achieve tumortargeted
gene therapeutic effect [28, 40]. Unfortunately,
there have been few reports about using survivin promoter

to drive shRNA in the anti-tumor study. Thus, we wanted
to test a strategy to downregulate eIF4E expression in a
tumor-specific manner by constructing survivin promoterdriven
shRNA eukaryotic expression vector.
In the present study, we could specifically downregulate
eIF4E expression in breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7)
but not in normal mammary epithelial cells (MCF210)
using DNA vector-based shRNA driven by survivin promoter.
Morever, the downregulation of eIF4E expression
significantly suppressed MCF-7 cell growth but had none
effect on the MCF210 cell growth. All these results
showed that the survivin promoter–driven RNA interference
system can inhibit targeted gene expression with
tumor specificity and high efficacy. To explore the
mechanism of growth inhibition, we detected the changes
of cell cycle in the MCF-7 cells stably expressing eIF4EshRNA2.
Results indicated that the eIF4E downregulation
induced an accumulation of the cells in the G0/G1 phase,
which led to proliferation suppression of breast carcinoma
cells. Next, we used survivin promoter-driven shRNA
vector targeting eIF4E to explore the antitumorigenic
effect in vivo. From tumorigenicity assay in nude mice,
we observed that the downregulation of eIF4E expression
obviously inhibited the tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore,
FCM and TUNEL stain assays indicated that
shRNA targeting eIF4E induced the increased apoptosis
of MCF-7 cells. In the eIF4E shRNA-induced apoptosis,
we found that downregulation of c-IAP1, c-IAP2 and
c-Myc but not Bcl-2 family proteins were involved in that
course, but the exact mechanism of eIF4E shRNAinduced
apoptosis needs to be further clarified. All
experimental data showed that the downregulation of
eIF4E expression could give rise to growth suppression
and lead to apoptosis induction in breast carcinoma cells.
Since the overexpressed eIF4E exerts profound effects
on cell growth and survival, and causes malignant transformation,
we explored the therapeutic role of eIF4E in
combination with chemotherapeutic drug. Cisplatin, a
platinum-based chemotherapy drug used to treat various
types of cancers, produces cell cytotoxicity by forming
inter- and intra-strand DNA cross-links and the cytotoxic
effect might result from replication inhibition by cisplatin-DNA
adducts and induction of apoptosis [41].
Cisplatin has also been widely applied in clinic to treat
human breast carcinoma, but the clinical therapeutic
results are not satisfying [42, 43]. It has been reported
that the overexpression of eIF4E induces the upregulated
levels of cyclinD1 expression which confers many tumors
cisplatin resistance. Thus, we believe that inhibition of
eIF4E expression might abolish the multidrug resistancerelated
signaling pathways leading to decreased efflux of
cisplatin from cells. In this study, as reported on other
human malignancies by other researchers, results from

chemosensitivity tests showed that the RNAi-mediated
downregulation of eIF4E expression synergistically
enhanced the cytotoxicity of cisplatin both in vitro and
in vivo, which made us believe that cisplatin chemotherapy
could be more effective in combination with RNAimediated
downregulation of eIF4E expression.
Taken together, our results suggest that the tumor-specific
survivin promoter can drive shRNA expression to
silence targeted gene in tumor cells but not in normal cell,
and the use of DNA vector-based shRNA technology can
effectively and specifically downregulate eIF4E gene
expression, which leads to growth suppression of breast
carcinoma cells and enhancement of chemosensitivity to
cisplatin both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the combination
of survivin promoter and shRNA will be a novel
strategy in targeted cancer gene therapy and may become a
promising approach for the chemosensitization of human
breast carcinomas in the future. Further researches should
focus on the delivery strategies that can direct eIF4EshRNA
vectors specifically into tumor cells with low toxicity
and high efficacy.
