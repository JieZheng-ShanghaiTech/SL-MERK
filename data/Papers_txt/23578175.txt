Abstract
Rearrangements of the proto‐oncogene
RET
are newly identified potential driver mutations in lung adenocarcinoma (
LAD
). However, the absence of cell lines harboring
RET
fusion genes has hampered the investigation of the biological relevance of
RET
and the development of
RET
‐targeted therapy. Thus, we aimed to identify a
RET
fusion positive
LAD
cell line. Eleven
LAD
cell lines were screened for
RET
fusion transcripts by reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction. The biological relevance of the
CCDC6‐RET
gene products was assessed by cell growth, survival and phosphorylation of
ERK
1/2 and
AKT
with or without the suppression of
RET
expression using
RNA
interference. The efficacy of
RET
inhibitors was evaluated
in vitro
using a culture system and in an
in vivo
xenograft model. Expression of the
CCDC6‐RET
fusion gene in
LC
‐2/ad cells was demonstrated by the
mRNA
and protein levels, and the genomic break‐point was confirmed by genomic
DNA
sequencing. Mutations in
KRAS
and
EGFR
were not observed in the
LC
‐2/ad cells.
CCDC
6‐
RET
was constitutively active, and the introduction of a
siRNA
targeting the
RET 3
' region decreased cell proliferation by downregulating
RET
and
ERK
1/2 phosphorylation. Moreover, treatment with
RET
‐inhibitors, including vandetanib, reduced cell viability, which was accompanied by the downregulation of the
AKT
and
ERK
1/2 signaling pathways. Vandetanib exhibited anti‐tumor effects in the xenograft model. Endogenously expressing
CCDC
6‐
RET
contributed to cell growth. The inhibition of kinase activity could be an effective treatment strategy for
LAD
.
LC
‐2/ad is a useful model for developing fusion
RET
‐targeted therapy.Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death worldwide.

The identification of oncogenic driver genes is to select the increasing number of small molecule inhibitors targeting these gene products.

In particular, in lung adenocarcinoma (LAD), the most dominant histological subtype of lung cancer, the application of kinase inhibitors for cases with specific gene alterations has been successful, that is, gefitinib and erlotinib for
EGFR
mutation‐positive cases and crizotinib for
ALK
fusion‐positive cases.

Furthermore, accumulating evidence has demonstrated somatic mutations and rearrangements of potential oncogenes, including
BRAF, ERBB2
and
ROS1,
in LAD.

RET
gene is located on chromosome 10 and encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase,

and the oncogenic potential of this gene product has been suggested in several tumors, including thyroid cancer.

Recently, five independent groups identified aberrant fusion genes,
KIF5B‐RET
and
CCDC6‐RET
in clinical samples of LAD.

Ectopically expressed RET fusion products afforded NIH3T3 cells with anchorage‐independent growth and tumorigenicity in nude mice.

14
Furthermore, KIF5B‐RET‐expressing H1299 cells exhibited growth factor‐independent growth.
11
These findings strongly suggest the oncogenic activity of RET fusion products and also suggest the potential therapeutic efficacy of multi‐kinase inhibitor targeting of RET using the abovementioned cells. However, LAD‐derived cell lines harboring
RET
fusion genes had not been identified. Recently, Matsubara
et al
.
21
screened LAD cell lines that were sensitive to a RET inhibitor vandetanib and found a
CCDC6‐RET
fusion gene‐harboring cell line, LC‐2/ad.
We have independently screened cell lines established from Japanese LAD samples by RT‐PCR and found that LC‐2/ad cells expressed the
CCDC6‐RET
fusion gene product. We further examined whether LC‐2/ad cells depend on RET fusion‐mediated signaling. In addition, the antitumor effect of RET inhibitors in LC‐2/ad cells was evaluated
in vitro
and
in vivo

Identification of the
CCDC6‐RET
fusion gene in a Japanese LAD cell line
To identify
RET
fusion‐derived mRNA expression in human LAD cell lines, all reported
KIF5B‐RET
and
CCDC6‐RET
gene products were screened by multiplex RT‐PCR in 11 cell lines derived from Japanese patients. LC‐2/ad cells were found to express
CCDC6‐RET
mRNA at significantly higher levels, whereas the other cell lines did not exhibit any fusion gene products (Fig.
1
a). The expressed fusion
RET
product was sequenced, and an in‐frame fusion of
CCDC6
exon 1 and
RET
exon 12, which was identical to the previously reported
CCDC6‐RET
fusion products, was identified (Fig.
1
b).
14
We then identified a breakpoint of chromosome 10 by retrieving genomic DNA fragments, including the entire
RET
gene and intron 1 of
CCDC6
, by target capture system followed by parallel sequencing. The identified break‐point between
CCDC6
intron 1 and
RET
exon 11 was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Fig.
1
b). Quantitative RT‐PCR revealed that the expression of 3′ end of
RET
was increased comparable to that of
CCDC6
, whereas the transcript level of the 5′ end of
RET
was significantly lower (Fig.
1
c). Consistent with the amount of transcript, western blotting using an antibody recognizing the C‐terminus of RET isoform 2 detected a 60‐kDa specific band equivalent to the estimated size of the fusion protein composed of 503 amino acids (GeneBank
{"type":"entrez-protein","attrs":{"text":"BAM36435","term_id":"401664166","term_text":"BAM36435"}}
BAM36435
), whereas no significant signal was detected that approximated the size of wild‐type RET, 170‐kDa (Fig.
1
d).
11
Taken together, we concluded that LC‐2/ad cells express
CCDC6‐RET
fusion gene products.
KRAS
exon 2 and
EGFR
exon 19 and 21 were examined by Sanger sequencing, but no obvious mutation was confirmed (Fig. S1).

protein isoform 2. The

a (blue arrowhead) band.
CCDC6‐RET‐dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation and the proliferation of LC‐2/ad cells
We suppressed
RET
expression by RNAi to characterize the function of CCDC6‐RET in LC‐2/ad cells. For avoiding off‐target siRNA effects, two different sequences of siRNA directed against the 3′ region of
RET
(siRET#1 and #2) and a nontargeting siRNA (siNC) were used. When compared to siNC, a significant reduction in mRNA expression was observed by quantitative RT‐PCR detecting the 3′ end of the
RET
mRNA: 66.5% for siRET#1 and 94.2% for siRET#2 (Fig. S2). Western blot analyses also revealed significant decreases in the expression of CCDC6‐RET protein (60‐kDa) upon the introduction of siRET#1 and #2 compared to the control siNC in the LC‐2/ad cells (Fig.
2
a). To examine whether the downstream signaling pathway was altered by the introduction of siRNA, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT was examined. The phospho‐ERK1/2 signal was significantly decreased by the suppression of CCDC6‐RET expression, whereas the decrease of AKT phosphorylation was marginal (Fig.
2
a). The involvement of RET fusion in LC‐2/ad cell proliferation was then examined. The number of live CCDC6‐RET‐suppressed cells decreased throughout the experiment, and the difference became significant at day 3 and thereafter (Fig.
2
b). To address the growth suppression further, the cell cycle of the siRNA‐treated cells were assessed by the DNA ploidy pattern. The LC‐2/ad cells treated with siRET exhibited significant increases in the percent of cells arrested in the G1 phase relative to the cells treated with siNC (Fig.
2
c). However, the apoptotic cells, as assessed by Annexin V positivity, was not significantly increased by the suppression of RET expression (Fig.
2
d).

RET‐dependent transcriptome profile in LC‐2/ad cell
To characterize the transcriptome profile, which is regulated by CCDC6‐RET and its downstream signaling pathway, siRET#2 and siNC treated LC‐2/ad cells were subjected to genome‐wide expression profiling using Affymetrix U133Plus2.0 arrays. A total of 243 genes, evaluated with 285 probes were selected as those preferentially suppressed by less than half in siRET‐treated cells.As well, 566 genes with 661 probes were expressed more than twice in siRET‐treated cells (Table S2 and Fig. S3). The
RET
gene itself (probe ID = 211421_s_at) showed the highest fold‐difference of 19.6 between siNC‐ and siRET#2‐treated cells. Following
RET
, previously identified Gene Ontology‐annotated Ras‐MAPK downstream genes like
DUSP6
was preferentially suppressed in the siRET‐treated cells. In addition, cell cycle regulation‐related genes like
EREG, CDC6, MCM10, MAD2L1, CHEK1
and
PLK4
were expressed <0.5‐fold in siRET‐treated cells (Table
1
).

RET
fusion gene screening of 300 consecutive surgically resected LAD samples identified one case of
CCDC6‐RET
expressing LAD by RT‐PCR and break‐apart FISH (Tsuta
et al
., 2012, unpublished data). We checked the expression level of potential CCDC6‐RET‐driven genes identified above in the clinical sample. Among 285 preferentially expressed probes, 81 probes were also upregulated more than twofold in the
CCDC6‐RET
positive LAD tissue compared to the surrounding non‐cancerous tissue (Table
1
and Table S2).
RET inhibitor‐induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in LC‐2/ad cells
The phosphorylation status of the tyrosine 905 residue of RET isoforms 2 and 4 was high in the LC‐2/ad cells, regardless of the presence or absence of serum in the culture medium, whereas the total amount of RET isoform 2 was not significantly altered. Similarly, the phosphorylation status of AKT and ERK1/2 was high under serum‐starved conditions, and the enhanced phosphorylation of these molecules was slight with serum stimulation, suggesting that the fusion RET kinase was constitutively active and activated its downstream signaling pathways (Fig.
3
a).

Next, the effects of kinase inhibitors, which inhibit spectrum including RET were applied to evaluate their effects on the signaling pathways in the LC‐2/ad cells. We treated the cells with RET inhibitors vandetanib, sunitinib and sorafenib at a final concentration of 10 μM, which was 10–30 times higher than the
in vitro
half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
50
) for RET kinase activity of each compound. Gefitinib, another small molecule inhibitor targeting EGFR but not RET,
13
was also examined. All the inhibitors except gefitinib significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of RET, AKT and ERK1/2. Although vandetanib, sunitinib and sorafenib equivalently suppressed RET phosphorylation, vandetanib most significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig.
3
a). The inhibitory effect of vandetanib on RET, AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylation exhibited concentration dependency (Fig.
3
b). Gefitinib significantly suppressed EGFR phosphorylation while total EGFR protein level was not altered. Meanwhile, gefitinib did not alter the phosphorylation status of AKT and ERK1/2 (Fig.
3
a). Meanwhile, vandetanib suppressed EGFR as well as AKT and ERK1/2 in
EGFR
‐mutant PC‐9 cells (Fig. S4).
We further examined the effect of the above inhibitors on the growth of the LC‐2/ad cells using the WST‐8 assay. Consistent with the effects of the inhibitors on the RET signaling pathway, vandetanib suppressed cell growth most significantly (IC
50
= 0.32 μM), followed by sunitinib and sorafenib, whereas gefitinib only exhibited an apparent suppression at its highest dose (Fig.
3
c). However, the effects of these inhibitors on
KRAS
‐mutant A549 cells were much lower (Fig. S5). Gefitinib and vandetanib, both of which inhibit EGFR, suppressed
EGFR
‐mutant PC‐9 cells, whereas sunitinib and sorafenib had less effect (Fig. S5). Evaluating the number of live cells by trypan blue staining under the treatment of several doses of vandetanib suggested a dose‐dependent suppression in the LC‐2/ad cells. Furthermore, the number of cells treated with 0.5 and 1.0 μM vandetanib was apparently reduced to less than the starting amount, strongly suggesting that vandetanib induced both cell death and the suppression of cell proliferation (Fig.
3
d). An assessment of the DNA ploidy revealed that vandetanib arrested the cell cycle in G1 phase in a dose‐dependent manner (Fig.
3
e), and an increased concentration of vandetanib induced an Annexin V‐positive apoptotic cell population (Fig.
3
f). The proapoptotic effect of vandetanib was confirmed by the detection of cleaved caspase‐3 by western blotting (Fig.
3
b). Meanwhile, 1.0 μM sunitinib and sorafenib induced cell cycle arrest but induction of apoptosis was marginal (Figs S6 and S7).
To further evaluate the contribution of Ras‐ERK and AKT axes to cell survival, LC‐2/ad cells were treated with MEK1/2 inhibitor AZD6244 or PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235. Cytotoxic effect of AKT‐inhibiting BEZ235 was more than that of ERK‐inhibiting AZD6244. However, both inhibitors did not completely reduce the cell survival even their maximal dose (Figs S8 and S9).
Anti‐tumor effect of vandetanib in an LC‐2/ad xenograft model
Subcutaneously transplanted LC‐2/ad tumors exhibited typical adenocarcinoma morphology. These tumors were positive for SFTPA, Napsin A and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) but thyroid marker thyroglobulin negative using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Furthermore, using an antibody cross‐reacting with both human and mouse RET protein, IHC revealed that RET was highly expressed specifically in the tumor cells but not in the interstitial cells (Fig.
4
a). The overexpression of RET in these tumors was confirmed using quantitative RT‐PCR and Western blotting. Similar to the results from cultured LC‐2/ad cells, much more mRNA of the 3′ end of
RET
was detected than that of the 5′ end (Fig.
4
b), and a specific band equivalent to the size of the CCDC6‐RET fusion protein was detected (Fig.
4
c). Vandetanib (50 mg/kg) was orally administrated to the mice harboring the LC‐2/ad xenograft, and the daily administration of vandetanib significantly reduced the tumor size. Although the tumors were diminished at day 14 of the treatment, the body weight of the treated mice was not significantly reduced (Fig.
4
d and Fig. S10). Sorafenib (30 mg/kg) and sunitinib (40 mg/kg) did not reduce the body weight, either (Fig. S10). Sorafenib reduced but not diminished the tumors at day14. Anti‐tumor effect of sunitinib was not significant (Fig. S11).

Previous reports suggest that the incidence of
RET
‐fusion‐positive cases in LAD is 1–2% and that these cases are concentrated in the
EGFR
mutation‐,
KRAS
mutation‐, and
ALK
‐fusion‐negative population.
10
,
27
To identify cell lines expressing endogenous
RET
‐fusion genes, we selected 11 cell lines that were derived from pathologically identified Japanese LAD cases. Among them, activating EGFR mutations have been reported in PC‐3 and PC‐9 cells.
28
However, the mutation status of known driver genes of other cell lines was not well investigated. The LC‐2/ad cells were originally derived from pleural effusion of LAD in a patient who had received combined chemotherapy (endoxan, Adriamycin, Cisplatin and mitomycin C)
23
; the cancer was diagnosed by cytological examination of the patient's sputum and pleural effusion. The original report indicated that the LC‐2/ad cells were positive for an adenocarcinoma marker, cytokeratin 18.
23
In addition, we detected surfactant protein, an aspartate proteinase, Napsin A, and CEA expression in the xenograft tumor (Fig.
4
a). These findings support the origin of LC‐2/ad as lung adenocarcinoma. The modal chromosome number described in the original report was 53–56, though an apparent translocation between the chromosomes was not reported, consistent with the fact that the inversion of chromosome 10 was not obvious in the conventional chromosome counts.
The Sanger sequencing in this study and the whole‐transcriptome sequencing (Tsuchihara, 2012, unpublished data) revealed no driver mutations of
KRAS
,
EGFR
and known genes other than the
CCDC6‐RET
fusion in the LC‐2/ad cells, highly suggesting that the CCDC6‐RET fusion protein plays pivotal roles in the proliferation of these cells. The autophosphorylation of CCDC6‐RET was clearly observed in a serum‐independent manner, accompanied with a constitutive elevation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The suppression of CCDC6‐RET expression induced a decrease in ERK1/2 phosphorylation, accompanied with a decrease in the expression of the genes that regulate the cell cycle. As a result, the CCDC6‐RET‐suppressed cells exhibited significant growth retardation.
Recently, a Japanese group independently reported the CCDC6‐RET fusion in LC2/ad cells.
21
However, the efficacy of RET inhibitors to the RET and downstream pathways and
in vivo
anti‐tumor effects have been partially described.
21
Vandetanib, sorafenib and sunitinib suppress the activities of multiple kinases, including RET, and have been approved for several cancers.
29
,
30
,
31
In
in vitro
analyses, these compounds effectively suppressed the phosphorylation of CCDC6‐RET and suppressed proliferation and induced death in LC‐2/ad cells. It should be noted that the IC
50
value for the growth suppression of these compounds was equivalent to the dose suggested in a previous study using culture cells expressing ectopic
KIF5B‐RET
cDNA.

These effects were most likely dependent on RET inhibition. Sunitinib and sorafenib did not affect PC‐9 and A549 cells, which have activating mutations of
EGFR
and
KRAS
, respectively. Vandetanib presumably suppressed the growth of PC‐9 cells, as EGFR is included in its inhibitory spectrum. Meanwhile, gefitinib, which targets EGFR but not RET, did not significantly suppress the growth of LC‐2/ad cells. Interestingly, gefitinib did not alter the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 in LC‐2/ad cells albeit equivalently suppressing EGFR phosphorylation as vandetanib. Although precise molecular mechanisms should be further examined, LC‐2/ad cells might not depend on EGFR for transducing downstream signaling.
Vandetanib exhibited apparent anti‐tumor effects in the xenograft model in this study. Recently, efficacy of vandetanib on thyroid cancer cells harboring
RET
‐fusion gene was also reported.
32
These findings strongly suggest that RET inhibition is a plausible therapeutic strategy for RET‐fusion‐positive tumors.
We noticed a discrepancy between the effects of RNA interference and inhibitor treatment on RET. Though RET suppression/inhibition equivalently reduced the level of phosphorylated RET and induced cell cycle arrest, obvious apoptosis was not found in the cells treated with siRNA. A possible explanation is that CCDC6‐RET is mainly involved in the RAS‐ERK pathway to regulate cell proliferation, whereas the anti‐apoptotic signaling pathway mediated by AKT could be regulated by other signaling molecules inhibited by the multi‐kinase inhibitors. A recent study using a Drosophila
in vivo
screening system suggested that the antitumor effects and toxicity of RET inhibitors were dependent on the profile of the “off‐target” inhibition of multiple kinases in addition to the specific inhibition of RET.
33
Further investigation elucidating the molecules and signaling pathways relevant to the cytotoxic effect of vandetanib in LC‐2/ad cells is anticipated.
Whether LC‐2/ad‐based models adequately represent clinical
RET
fusion‐positive LAD cases is another challenging question. Takeuchi stated that clinically identified
CCDC6‐RET
‐positive LAD exhibited a histologically cribriform pattern.
14
Because the cribriform structure was presumably developed from normal alveolar architecture, this specific morphology was not observed in the subcutaneously transplanted LC‐2/ad tumors. We assume that the comparison of the transcriptome profile between the LC‐2/ad cells and clinically identified LAD tissue samples may provide clues. Approximately one‐third of the genes suppressed by RNA interference directed at
RET
overlapped with the genes preferentially expressed in the clinical tumor sample. Because we have had only one example of paired data, it is difficult to estimate the similarity between the cell line and clinical samples. However, the above overlap appears promising, and we will continue to screen both cell lines and clinical samples to accumulate comprehensive data.
In this study, the screening of Japanese LAD cell lines was effective for the identification of
RET
fusion‐positive cancer cells, representing a clinically rare subpopulation. LC‐2/ad cells might be useful in the development of RET‐targeted therapies, that is, new compound screening, clarifying the pharmacological mechanisms and investigating the mechanisms for acquired resistance.Disclosure Statement
