Abstract. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi)
are currently evaluated in clinical trials in combination with
topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitors against a variety of cancers,
including colon carcinoma. Since the mismatch repair component
MLH1 is defective in 10-15% of colorectal cancers we
have investigated whether MLH1 affects response to the Top1
inhibitor irinotecan, alone or in combination with PARPi. To
this end, the colon cancer cell lines HCT116, carrying MLH1
mutations on chromosome 3 and HCT116 in which the wildtype
MLH1 gene was replaced via chromosomal transfer
(HCT116+3) or by transfection of the corresponding MLH1
cDNA (HCT116 1-2) were used. HCT116 cells or HCT116+3
cells stably silenced for PARP-1 expression were also analysed.
The results of in vitro and in vivo experiments indicated
that MLH1, together with low levels of Top1, contributed to
colon cancer resistance to irinotecan. In the MLH1-proficient
cells SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, induced lower
levels of DNA damage than in MLH1-deficient cells, as shown
by the weaker induction of γ-H2AX and p53 phosphorylation.
The presence of MLH1 contributed to induce of prompt
Chk1 phosphorylation, restoring G2/M cell cycle checkpoint
and repair of DNA damage. On the contrary, in the absence
of MLH1, HCT116 cells showed minor Chk1 phosphorylation
and underwent apoptosis. Remarkably, inhibition of PARP

function by PARPi or by PARP-1 gene silencing always
increased the antitumor activity of irinotecan, even in the
presence of low PARP-1 expression.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause
of cancer-related death in many industrialized countries.
Although the addition of oxaliplatin or of the topoisomerase
I (Top1) inhibitor irinotecan to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/
leucovorin regimen has greatly improved survival (1), treatment
failure frequently occurs. Resistance to Top1 poisons has
been generally attributed to overexpression of efflux pumps
and low expression or mutations of Top1 (2). Strategies to
counteract resistance to Top1 poisons include their combination
with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors
(PARPi) (3-7). PARP-1 is the oldest member of a family of
enzymes that synthesizes and transfers ADP-ribose polymers
to acceptor proteins (including PARP-1 itself) using NAD+
as a substrate. PARP-1 has a key role in the surveillance and
maintenance of genome integrity, sensing DNA breaks and
signalling damage to DNA repair pathways (8). The interaction
of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP-1 with specific domains
of Top1 results in disjoining of Top1-DNA cleavable complex
and favours resealing of strand breaks by the ligase activity of
Top1 (9). Thus, PARPi would remove the antagonistic effect
exerted by poly(ADP-ribose) on the mechanism of action of
Top1 poisons, contributing to the formation of persistent DNA
breaks (10). Another explanation for the synergism between
PARPi and irinotecan implies the intervention of the base excision
repair (BER) in the repair of the DNA damage induced by
the Top1 poison (5).
The MMR that eliminates replication errors and maintains
genomic stability can be defective in familial or sporadic CRC
and contributes to drug resistance/sensitivity (11). MMR is
composed of several proteins forming different heterodimers:
MutSα (MSH2/MSH6) recognizes single base mismatches, as

well as 1-bp insertion-deletion loops, whereas MutSβ (MSH2/
MSH3) primarily recognizes 2-4-bp insertion-deletion loops;
MutLα, (MLH1/PMS2), forms a ternary complex with a MutS
heterodimer that binds to mismatches during replication,
recruiting other proteins to complete the repair process (11).
MutSα and MutLα also contribute to signal transduction pathways
which lead to growth arrest or cell death induced by the
methylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) (12,13).
While the influence of MutSα and MutLα function in
TMZ-induced sensitivity is known, the role of MLH1 in CRC
susceptibility to irinotecan is controversial (6,14-19). On the
other hand, MLH1-deficiency confers resistance to cisplatin or
carboplatin, but not to oxaliplatin (20).
Aims of the present study were to clarify whether MLH1
loss of function affects colon cancer sensitivity to irinotecan
and whether lack of PARP-1 expression/activity has different
outcome depending on MLH1 status.

Materials and methods

Cell lines and transfection. The colon cancer HCT116 cell line
has a hemizygous nonsense mutation in the MLH1 gene located
on chromosome 3 (21). The MLH1-proficient HCT116/3-6
cell line (HCT116+3) was created by microcell chromosome
transfer of a single normal human chromosome (22) and
kindly provided by Dr Giancarlo Marra (Institute of Molecular
Cancer Research, University of Zürich, Switzerland). The
HCT116 1-2 and HCT116 0-1 cells were generated by transfection
with the full-length wild-type MLH1 cDNA cloned into
the pcDNA3.1/Hygro vector or with the empty control vector,
respectively (15). Cell lines were cultured in DMEM (SigmaAldrich,
Milan, Italy), supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and antibiotics. The HCT116+3
cells were cultured in the presence of 400 µg/ml geneticin
(Sigma-Aldrich), the HCT116 1-2 and HCT116 0-1 cells in the
presence of 100 µg/ml hygromycin (Sigma-Aldrich).
Stable silencing of PARP-1 in HCT116+3 cells (HCT116+3
SiP) was obtained by co-transfection of the pBS-U6-SiP912
vector and the pBabe vector, carrying the puromycin resistance
gene. HCT116+3 cells, transfected with pBabe vector
only, were used as control (HCT116+3 Babe). The HCT116 SiP
and Babe cell lines were previously described (23). Cells were
maintained in the presence of 1 µg/ml puromycin (SigmaAldrich).Drugs
for in vitro studies. SN-38 (2.5 mM, Alexis), TMZ
(100 mM, Sigma-Aldrich) and 7-hydroxystaurosporine
(UCN-01, 100 nM, Sigma-Aldrich) stock solutions were
prepared by dissolving the drugs in dimethyl sulfoxide. The
final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide was always <0.5%
(v/v) and did not contribute to toxicity. The PARP inhibitor
GPI 15427 [10-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-2H-7-oxa-1,2-
diazabenzo[de]anthracen-3-one, Eisai, Baltimore, MD, USA]
stock solution (1 mM) was prepared by dissolving GPI 15427
in 70 mM PBS without potassium (24).

Cell growth assays. Cell proliferation of colon cancer cell lines
was evaluated by colony formation assay. Cells were seeded in
triplicate into 6-well plates (2x102
/well) and, after overnight
incubation, treated with SN-38, TMZ or GPI 15427. Cells were

cultured to allow colony-formation; after 10 days colonies
were fixed, stained with 2% methylene blue in 95% ethanol
and counted. Only colonies comprising >50 cells were scored
as survival colonies. Chemosensitivity was evaluated in terms
of IC50, i.e., the concentration of the drug capable of inhibiting
cell growth by 50%.

Flow cytometry analysis. Apoptosis and cell cycle perturbations
induced by the drugs were evaluated by flow cytometry
analysis of the DNA content. Untreated or drug treated cells
(1x106
) were washed with PBS and fixed in 70% ethanol at -20˚C
for ≥18 h. Cells were then centrifuged, suspended in 1 ml of a
solution containing 0.1% (w/v) sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton-X
(v/v), 50 µg/ml propidium iodide, 10 µg/ml RNase and incubated
in the dark at 37˚C for 15 min. The fluorescence was
measured on a linear scale using a FACScan flow cytometer
and the CellQuest software. Data collection was gated using
forward light scatter and side scatter to exclude cell debris
and aggregates. Apoptotic cells were represented by a broad
hypodiploid peak easily distinguishable from the diploid DNA
content in the red fluorescence channel. For cell cycle analysis,
the Mod-Fit software version 3.0 was used (Becton-Dickinson,
San Jose, CA, USA).

Western blot analysis. For immunoblot analysis the following
primary antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-human
phosphorylated p53 (Ser15) (Cell Signaling Technology;
Beverly, MA, USA; 1:1,000 dilution); rabbit polyclonal
anti-human phosphorylated Chk2 (Thr68) (Cell Signaling
Technology; 1:1,000); rabbit polyclonal anti-human β-tubulin
(clone H-235; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA,
USA; 1:400); rabbit polyclonal anti-human γ-H2AX (phosphoS139)
(Abcam, Cambridge, UK; 1:1,000); mouse monoclonal
antibody anti-human Chk1 (G4, Santa Cruz Biotechnology
Inc; 1:500); rabbit monoclonal anti-human phosphorylated
Chk1 (Ser345) (133D3, Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1,000);
mouse monoclonal anti-human MLH1 (clone G168-15, BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA; 1/500); mouse monoclonal
anti-calf PARP-1 (clone C2-10; Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD,
USA; 1:2,000 dilution); mouse monoclonal anti-human Top1
(clone C-21 BD Biosciences; 1:500). Anti-rabbit and antimouse
secondary antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich) were used at the
appropriate dilutions. Signals were quantified using a Kodak
densitometer (Rochester, NY, USA).

PARP activity assay. Cells (5x106
) were lysed in 0.5 ml of a
buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0,
0.6 mM EDTA, 14 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM MgCl2
and protease inhibitors. Proteins (25 µg) were incubated with
2 µCi 32P-NAD+
 (GE Healthcare, Milan, Italy), 100 µM NAD+
,
50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 14 mM β-mercaptoethanol,
in the presence (maximally stimulated activity) or absence
(basal activity) of 10 µg nuclease-treated salmon testes
DNA. After 15 min at 30˚C the reaction was stopped adding
ice-cold trichloroacetic acid 20% (v/v). The radioactivity
associated with the acid-insoluble material, corresponding
to poly (ADP-ribosyl)ated proteins, was counted on a liquid
scintillation counter. PARP activity was evaluated as fmol of
32P-NAD+
/µg of protein and data were presented as the ratio
between maximally stimulated and basal activity.

Immunofluorescence microscopy of γ-H2AX. Cells were
grown on poly-L-lysine coated glass coverslips and treated
with SN-38. After 24 h, slides were washed twice with PBS
and fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min.
Cells were permeabilised with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for
2 min, incubated in 2.5% goat serum-PBS for 20 min and
with rabbit anti-γ-H2AX polyclonal antibody for 2 h (Abcam,
1:250 in 2.5% goat serum-PBS). After washing in PBS, cells
were incubated with goat anti-rabbit-Alexa 488 secondary
antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA; 1:2,000) for
1 h. Slides were counterstained by vectashield antifade solution
containing 4,6 diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and examined with a
fluorescent microscope (Nikon Eclipse, E600, Yokohama,
Japan). Images were analysed with the Arkon FISH program
(Nikon). For quantitative analysis, foci were counted by eye
during the microscopic and imaging process using a x100
objective. Cells with ≥5 foci were considered positive for
γ-H2AX expression (28).

In vivo studies. The intramuscular transplantation procedure
was performed as previously described (6). Tumor cells (3x106
)
were inoculated intramuscularly (i.m.) in male athymic CD-1
mice (nu/nu genotype, 6/group; Charles River, Calco, Milan,
Italy). Xenograft growth was monitored by measuring tumor
nodules with calliper every 2-3 days for 3 weeks and volumes
were calculated according to the following formula: [(width)2
x length]/2. Irinotecan (Campto®, Aventis, Milan, Italy) was

administered intraperitoneally (i.p) at 5 mg/kg/dx5d; treatment
started when nodules reached 300 mm3
. The animals
were euthanized when their tumors reached a volume of ~1500
mm3
. All procedures involving mice and care were performed
in compliance with our institutional animal care guidelines
and with international directives (directive 2010/63/EU of
the European parliament and of the council; Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, United States National
Research Council, 2011). The study was approved by the ethics
committee of the University of Rome ‘Tor Vergata’.

Results

Analysis of MLH1 and Top1 expression and of sensitivity to
Top1 inhibitor in HCT116 colon cancer cells transfected with
the wild-type MLH1 cDNA or with chromosome 3. In order
to evaluate the influence of MLH1 and Top1 or both in the
susceptibility to the Top1 poison we initially performed immunoblot
analysis of Top1 in the parental HCT116 cell line (devoid
of MLH1 protein as a result of mutation in the MLH1 gene
located on chromosome 3), in an HCT116 clone transfected
with a control vector (HCT116 0-1) or with a vector expressing
the wild-type MLH1 cDNA (HCT116 1-2) and in HCT116 cells
in which MLH1 was introduced by transfer of chromosome 3
(HCT116+3). Our results indicated that HCT116, HCT116 0-1
and HCT116 1-2 expressed high and comparable levels of Top1
protein. On the other hand, HCT116+3 cells showed very low
Top1 expression (Fig. 1A). Then we analysed the sensitivity

lysates from parental HCT116 cells, HCT116 1-2 cells, transfected with MLH1 cDNA, and HCT116 0-1 cells, transfected with the empty control vector, or
HCT116+3 cells, in which MLH1 had been introduced by chromosome transfer, were electrophoresed and analysed for the expression of MLH1, Top1 and
tubulin. Histograms represent the ratios between the optical densities (OD) of Top1 and those of tubulin. The results are representative of one out of two
experiments with similar results. (B) In vitro chemosensitivity. Tumor cell susceptibility to SN-38 or TMZ was assessed by colony-formation assay and
the results were expressed as IC50. Only colonies comprising >50 cells were scored as survival colonies. Data are means [± standard deviation (SD)] from
three independent experiments. The results of statistical analysis by Student's t-test of the differences in sensitivity are as follows: SN-38, HCT116 0-1 vs.
HCT116 1-2, **P=0.003; TMZ, HCT116 0-1 vs. HCT116 1-2, ***P<0.0001; SN-38, HCT116 vs. HCT116+3, **P=0.002; TMZ, HT116 vs. HCT116+3, ***P<0.0001.

of MLH1-deficient and -proficient cells to SN-38, the active
metabolite of irinotecan and to the methylating agent TMZ, as
a control for MLH1 functional proficiency. In fact, MLH1 is
required for the processing and cytotoxicity of O6
MethylG/T
mispairs generated by TMZ. The results, expressed as IC50,
indicated that the MLH1-deficient HCT116 0-1 and HCT116

cells were more sensitive to SN-38 as compared to MLH1-
proficient HCT116 1-2 and HCT116+3 cells (Fig. 1B). The
lower constitutive expression of Top1 might contribute to the
higher SN-38 resistance of HCT116+3 cells compared with
HCT116 1-2 cells (Fig. 1A). In HCT116 and HCTT116+3 cells

(left) and activity (right). Immunoblot analysis was performed in HCT116 or HCT116+3 clones transfected with the pBabe vector (HCT-116 Babe or HCT116+3
Babe) or with the pBabe and pBS-U6-SiP912 vectors (HCT-116 SiP or HCT116+3 SiP). Cellular extracts were electrophoresed and analysed for the expression
of PARP-1 or tubulin. Total cellular PARP activity was measured in cell extracts, in the absence (basal activity) or in the presence of nuclease-treated
DNA (maximally stimulated activity) and 32P-NAD+
. The results were expressed as means (± SD) of stimulated and basal activity ratios of three independent
experiments. The results of statistical analysis by Student's t-test of the differences in PARP activity ratios are as follows: HCT116 Babe vs. HCT116+3 Babe, ***P<0.0001; HCT116 Babe vs. HCT116 SiP, ***P<0.0001; HCT116+3 Babe vs. HCT116+3 SiP, ***P<0.0001; HCT116 SiP vs. HCT116+3 SiP; NS, not significant.
(B) Comparison of HCT116 or HCT116+3 sensitivity to SN-38, as single agent or in combination with a PARPi, with that of PARP-1 silenced HCT116 or
HCT116+3 cells. Control HCT116 or HCT116+3 (Babe) or PARP-1 silenced (SiP) cells were exposed to graded concentrations of SN-38 (S) and analysed by
colony-formation assay. In the case of Babe cells SN-38 was also combined with the PARPi GPI 15427 (Pi), at a concentration (0.3 µM) capable of significantly
inhibiting cellular PARP activity (70-75% inhibition of the synthesis of ADP-ribose polymers) and devoid of a significant growth inhibitory effect (<15%).
The results were expressed as IC50. Data are means (± SD) from three independent experiments. The results of statistical analysis by Student's t-test of the
differences in sensitivity are as follows: HCT116 Babe treated with SN-38 vs. HCT116 Babe treated with SN-38+PARPi, **P=0.004; HCT116 Babe treated with

SiP treated with SN-38; NS, not significant. (C) Analysis of in vivo chemosensitivity of HCT116+3 Babe and SiP cells in mice treated with irinotecan. Mice
were inoculated i.m. with Babe (n=6) or SiP (n=6) HCT116+3 cells and treated with irinotecan (as indicated in Materials and methods). Statistical analysis by
Student's t-test indicated that the growth of SiP grafts is significantly inhibited by irinotecan compared with untreated control grafts (***P<0.001 from day 13
onward); differences between the volumes of tumor nodules of untreated or drug treated mice injected with HCT116+3, NS, not significant.

cassette transporter, which is regarded as an important determinant
of resistance to camptothecins, was, instead, equally
expressed (6). On the contrary, MLH1 proficiency conferred
sensitivity to TMZ to a similar extent in both cellular models
(Fig. 1B).

Lack of PARP-1 activity increases the sensitivity to irinotecan
in MLH1-proficient and -deficient HCT116 cells. We then
evaluated the influence on tumor sensitivity to SN-38 of downregulation
of PARP function by PARP-1 gene silencing and
by pharmacological inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis
using PARPi. To this end HCT116 and HCT116+3 were stably
silenced for PARP-1 expression (SiP clones) by transfection of
a siRNA vector targeting specific sequences of PARP-1, which
is responsible for >90% of the cellular poly(ADP-ribosyl)
ating activity. Control clones were obtained by transfection
of the pBabe vector only (Babe clones). Immunoblot analysis
and PARP activity assay (Fig. 2A) revealed lack of PARP-1
expression and negligible synthesis of poly(ADP-ribose) in
SiP clones. Moreover, HCT116 Babe cells showed significantly
higher levels of PARP-1 expression and activity compared
with HCT116+3 Babe cells.
Then, control Babe clones were tested for their susceptibility
to the anti-proliferative effects of SN-38 in combination
with a PARPi and the results compared to those obtained in
their SiP counterparts. Pharmacological inhibition of PARP

activity by GPI 15427 significantly increased sensitivity to
SN-38 both in MLH1-deficient and in MLH1-proficient cells, as
indicated by the IC50 values of SN-38 in the presence of PARPi
that were ~6-fold lower than those of SN-38 used as single
agent (Fig. 2B). PARP-1 silenced clones were ~2-4-fold more
susceptible to the Top1 poison than control clones (Fig. 2B).
The enhancing effect mediated by PARPi or PARP-1 gene
silencing was more pronounced in the less sensitive HCT116+3
cells (Fig. 2B). Noteworthy, in vivo studies showed that lack of
PARP-1 expression in HCT116+3 SiP cells resulted in a higher
tumor growth inhibition induced by irinotecan compared with
HCT116+3 Babe cells (Fig. 2C). Analysis of the doubling
times, evaluated on the basis of the growth kinetics of each
clone, indicated that SiP clones possessed doubling times in
the same range of those observed in PARP-1 proficient clones
(22-26 h). Therefore, the distinct chemosensitivity profiles of
Babe and SiP clones did not depend on different proliferation
rates.
According to the results of colony formation assay, immunoblot
analysis of histone H2AX phosphorylation (γ-H2AX),
as an indicator of DSB, showed that treatment with SN-38
induced histone phosphorylation at higher level in HCT116
Babe than in HCT116+3 Babe cells and in PARP-1 silenced
clones with respect to their PARP-1 proficient controls
(Fig. 3A). Immunofluorescence analysis of γ-H2AX foci in
cells treated with SN-38 confirmed the results of immunonFigure

with similar results. (B) Immunofluorescence analysis of γ-H2AX foci (green) in untreated or SN-38 treated cells. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). The

oblot analysis of γ-H2AX expression (Fig. 3B). The data also
showed that the increment of γ-H2AX expression and foci
formation resulting from the comparison of HCT116+3 SiP
with HCT116+3 Babe cells was higher than that deriving from
HCT116 SiP and HCT116 Babe comparison (Fig. 3).
Since MLH1 is known to be involved in DNA damageinduced
checkpoint, signalling the control of G2/M arrest
by methylating agents like TMZ through phosphorylation of
Chk1 (25-27), we have investigated whether treatment with
SN-38 might induce different kinetics of induction of Chk1
phosphorylation and cell cycle perturbations depending on
the presence of MLH1 and/or PARP-1. The results of immunoblot
analysis of Chk1 phosphorylation revealed that SN-38
treatment induced an earlier Chk1 phosphorylation (3 h) in
MLH1-proficient cells than in MLH1-deficient cells (Fig. 4A).
At a later time-point (6 h) the highest level of Chk1 phosphorylation
was detected in cells silenced for PARP-1, regardless of
MLH1 expression (Fig. 4A). Cell treatment with SN-38 did not
result in Chk2 phosphorylation (data not shown). Cell cycle

analysis at 24 h after treatment showed a dose-dependent cell
accumulation at the G2/M phase (Fig. 4B for HCT116+3 Babe
and Sip cells; data not shown for HCT116 Babe and Sip cells).
At 72 h after treatment the percentage of cells in the G2/M
phase decreased in both Babe cell lines, whereas both PARP-1
silenced cells underwent G2/M arrest (Fig. 4B for HCT116+3
Babe and SiP cells; data not shown for HCT116 Babe and SiP
cells).
In HCT116 MLH1-deficient Babe and SiP clones treatment
with SN-38 induced a dose-dependent and marked increase
of p53 phosphorylation and of the percentage of apoptotic
cells; this effect was more pronounced in PARP-1 silenced
cells (Fig. 5). On the other hand, in HCT116+3 Babe and SiP
cells only marginal level of p53 phosphorylation and apoptosis
were detected (Fig. 5). Treatment of HCT116+3 Babe
and SiP cells with a non-toxic concentration of the Chk1
inhibitor UCN-01 reduced the G2/M cell accumulation (data
not shown) favouring apoptosis induction by SN-38 in both
cell lines (Fig. 5B).

phosphorylation. HCT116 and HCT116+3 Babe or SiP cells were treated with SN-38 (1.2 and 2.5 nM) for 3 and 6 h; cell lysates were electrophoresed and
analysed for the expression of phosphorylated Chk1 (P-Chk1) or Chk1. Histograms represent the ratios between the OD of phosphorylated Chk1 (after subtraction

Discussion

Germline mutations of MMR genes or epigenetic inactivation
of MLH1 may be present in CRC and influence the clinical
behavior (28,29). While the lack of function of MLH1 and
the presence of microsatellite instability have been associated
with lower response to 5-FU (30), the predictive impact of the
MLH1 functional status for irinotecan, as single agent or in
combination with PARPi, needs to be clarified. Using a panel
of human colon cancer cell lines derived from HCT116 and
characterized by different patterns of MLH1, Top1 and PARP-1
expression, we investigated the influence of these proteins on
colon cancer cell response to irinotecan, as single agent or
in combination with PARPi. To study the impact of MLH1
expression on colon cancer cell chemosensitivity we used
cell lines in which the defective gene product was restored by
chromosome transfer or by transfection of the corresponding
wild-type cDNA. The results indicated that MLH1-proficiency
and low Top1 expression resulted in reduced sensitivity to
irinotecan, but pharmacological inhibition of PARP activity or
silencing of PARP-1 gene increased the susceptibility of colon

cancer cells to the Top1 poison. Interestingly, cells with lower
levels of PARP-1 protein could still be sensitized to irinotecan
by PARPi.
DNA damage consequent to Top1 poisoning derives from
stabilization of the cleavable complex formed by Top1 and
DNA, with formation of a transient single strand DNA nick.
When the stabilized drug-DNA-Top1 complex collides with
replication or transcription machineries, it leads to replication
fork stalling and eventually DSB. Before DSB generation, the
repair of DNA damage induced by Top1 inhibitors includes
proteasomal degradation of Top1, hydrolysis of the phosphodiester
bond, between the 3'-end of DNA and a tyrosine
residue of Top1, by the tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase-1 and
removal of Top1-cleavable complex by the endonucleases
XPF-ERCC1 (2). In MLH1-proficient cells SN-38 induced a
lower level of DNA damage with respect to MLH1-deficient
cells, as evidenced by the weak induction of γ-H2AX and
p53 phosphorylation. The presence of MLH1 contributed to
induce prompt Chk1 phosphorylation, restoring G2/M cell
cycle checkpoint and repair of DNA damage. On the contrary,
in the absence of MLH1, HCT116 cells showed minor Chk1

Figure 5. Analysis of p53 activation (A) and apoptosis induction (B) in MLH1-deficient HCT116 Babe and SiP cells treated with SN-38. (A) HCT116 and
HCT116+3 Babe or SiP cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of SN-38 for 6 h; cell lysates were electrophoresed and analysed for the expression
of phosphorylated p53 (P-p53) or tubulin. Histograms represent the ratios between the OD of phospho-p53 in SN-38 treated groups and tubulin. The results are
representative of one out of two experiments with similar results. (B) Apoptosis was analysed by flow cytometry in HCT116 and HCT116+3 Babe or SiP cells
at 72 h after treatment with SN-38. In the case of HCT116+3 Babe and SiP cells SN-38 was also tested in combination with 100 nM UCN-01 (striped columns).
Histograms represent the mean percentage values (± SD) of apoptotic cells from three independent experiments. The results of statistical analysis by Student's
t-test of the differences in sensitivity to apoptosis induction are as follows: left histogram, 2.5 nM SN-38 HCT116 Babe vs. HCT116 SiP, *
P=0.02; 5 nM SN-38,
HCT116 Babe vs. HCT116 SiP, ***P=0.004; 10 nM SN-38 HCT116 Babe vs. HCT116 SiP; NS, not significant; right histogram, HCT116+3 Babe, 2.5 nM SN-38
vs. 2.5 nM SN-38+UCN-01, **P=0.002; 10 nM SN-38 vs. 10 nM SN-38+UCN-01, **P=0.005; HCT116+3 SiP, 2.5 nM SN-38 vs. 2.5 nM SN-38+UCN-01, **P=0.002; 10 nM SN-38 vs. 10 nM SN-38+UCN-01, **P=0.003.

phosphorylation and underwent apoptosis. Actually, inhibition
of Chk1 by UCN-01 decreased G2/M cell accumulation
induced by the Top1 poison in MLH1-proficient cells and triggered
apoptosis. Treatment with SN-38 did not result in Chk2
phosphorylation (data not shown) likely for the presence of
mutations in the Mre11 gene. The consequent lack of Mre11
protein (31) and very low expression of RAD50 cause destabilization
of the MRN complex, which is required for Chk2
phosphorylation by ATM in response to DSB (32).
Low levels of Top1 protein are known to confer a moderate
level of resistance to camptothecins due to the formation of
a small amount of DNA-Top1 cleavable complexes (2). Since
HCT116+3 cells expressed lower level of Top1 protein with
respect to HCT116 cells, this might have contributed to the
poorer response of HCT116+3 cells to irinotecan. In fact, the
sensitivity to SN-38 of HCT116 1-2 cells transfected with the
MLH1 cDNA differed to a lesser extent from that of HCT116
control cells, which showed comparable Top1 expression. Our
data indicated that when a defective gene product is replaced
by chromosome transfer the expression of other proteins
involved in tumor drug response may change and influence
tumor chemosensitivity.
Pharmacological inhibition or stable gene silencing
of PARP-1 increased sensitivity to SN-38 both in MLH1-
proficient and -deficient cells. Notably, the enhancing effect
deriving from abrogation of PARP-1 function was particularly
evident in the HCT116+3 derived line and translated into an
increased in vivo response of HCT116+3 SiP to irinotecan.
Tumor chemosensitization mediated by lack of function of
PARP-1 is likely due to the decrease of DNA repair mediated
by the BER system. PARP-1 contributes to the repair of Top1
mediated damage promoting the recruitment of XRRC1 and
tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase-1 with removal of Top1 from
DNA (5). These results are consistent with the reported higher
toxicity of Top1 poisons in cervical cancer or in melanoma
cells stably silenced for PARP-1 (33,34). On the other hand, the
transient silencing of PARP-1 in an ovarian cancer cell line did
not result in chemosensitisation to Top1 poisons (35). During
the preparation of this study, a report was published indicating
that the PARPi veliparib synergized with irinotecan in vitro
in HCT116 cells (36). In our study we showed, for the first
time, that the chemosensitising effect induced by pharmacological
inhibition of PARP or by PARP-1 gene silencing can
be achieved even in the presence of low Top1 levels and in the
case of both MLH1-proficient and MLH1-deficient tumors.
In PARP-1 silenced cells devoid also of MLH1 expression
SN-38 induced more DNA damage than in MLH1-proficient
SiP cells, causing a remarkable p53 phosphorylation and apoptosis
induction. In MLH1-deficient SiP cells the Top1 poison
also induced a delayed (compared with MLH1-proficient SiP)
but robust Chk1 phosphorylation, suggesting that MLH1
might influence the kinetics of induction rather than the extent
of Chk1 post-translational modifications.
Interestingly, the low levels of PARP-1 expression in
HCT116+3 cells did not hamper the chemosensitising effect
mediated by the PARPi GPI 15427 in combination with
SN-38. These results are different from those obtained in MEF
lines derived from PARP-1-/- mice that could not be sensitized
to topotecan by the PARPi veliparib (35). However, in MEF
cells PARP-1 was totally lacking, whereas in HCT116+3 cells

PARP-1, even though expressed at lower levels than in HCT116
cells, was sufficient to allow the chemosensitising effect by
GPI 15427.
In conclusion, these data indicated that MLH1, together
with low levels of Top1, contributes to colon cancer resistance
to Top1 poisons. Remarkably, inhibition of PARP-1 function
always increases the antitumor activity of irinotecan even in
the presence of low PARP-1 expression.
