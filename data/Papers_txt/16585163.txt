Abstract

Deletion at chromosome 3p21.3 is the earliest and the most
frequently observed genetic alteration in lung cancer, suggesting
that the region contains tumor suppressor gene(s) (TSG).
Identification of those genes may lead to the development
both of biomarkers to identify high-risk individuals and novel
therapeutics. Previously, we cloned the H37/Luca15/RBM5
gene from 3p21.3 and showed its TSG characteristics. To
investigate the physiologic function of H37 in the lung and its
mechanism of tumor suppression, we have stably transfected
H37 into A549 non–small cell lung cancer cells. A549/H37 cells
show significant growth inhibition compared with the vector
controls by in vitro and in vivo cell proliferation assays. Using
this lung cancer cell model, we have found that the molecular
mechanism of H37 tumor suppression involves both cell cycle
(G1) arrest and apoptosis. To further define H37’s function in
cell cycle/apoptotic pathways, we investigated differential
expression profiles of various cell cycle and apoptosis
regulatory proteins using Western blot analysis. Both cyclin
A and phophorylated RB levels were decreased in H37-
transfected cells, whereas expression of Bax protein was
increased. Mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis further
downstream of Bax was investigated, showing change in the
mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release into
the cytosol, and enhanced caspase-9 and caspase-3 activities.
We also report that H37 may mediate apoptosis in a p53-
independent manner, and Bax knockdown by small interfering
RNA suggests Bax plays a functional role downstream of H37.
Lastly, we proposed a tumor suppression model of H37 as a
post-transcriptional regulator for cell cycle/apoptotic–related
proteins. (Cancer Res 2006; 66(7): 3419-27)

Introduction

The loss of tumor suppressor gene (TSG) function is a critical step
in the pathogenesis of human lung cancer. Deletion at chromosome
3p21.3 is the most frequent genetic alteration identified in lung
cancer, observed in >90% of small cell lung cancers (SCLC) and in
50% to 80% of non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), indicating that
the region contains one or more TSGs (1). Furthermore, loss of alleles
at a 370-kb region of 3p21.3 is the earliest alteration found in
preneoplastic lesions of the lung and sometimes in histologically
normal lung epithelium of smokers (2). This timing suggests that

3p21.3 TSGs play a role in preventing lung cancer initiation.
Thus, isolation and characterization of the 3p TSGs could be a first
step toward developing new targeted treatments and diagnostic
tools for lung cancer. Accordingly, the search for TSGs in this
region has been the focus of extensive research over the past two
decades, and many genes mapping to this region have recently
been characterized (3–9). The two most prominent genes, already
being evaluated for clinical utility, are fus-1 (phase I clinical trial;
refs. 10, 11) and RASSF-1A (epigenetic biomarker; refs. 12, 13).
We previously showed that the H37 gene (also called Luca15 or
RBM5; refs. 14, 15), concurrently cloned by us and others in 1996
and located in the 3p21.3 tumor suppressor region, has the
characteristics of a TSG. We found reduced expression (compared
with adjacent normal tissue) of the H37 transcript in 9 of 11 (82%)
primary NSCLCs (16). By generating a polyclonal H37 antibody and
using it for immunohistochemical analysis of primary NSCLC
specimens, we further showed that 46 of the 62 (73%) cancers
underexpressed H37 protein (16). Moreover, when we introduced
H37 cDNA into human breast cancer cells that had 3p21-22
deletions, both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent
growth was reduced (16). We found that subsequent transfection of
H37 cDNA into one of the human lung cancer cell lines with a
homozygous deletion in the TSG region (NCI-H740) resulted in a
very low yield of H37-expressing clones, suggesting that H37 has
antiproliferative properties (16). We also found that H37 suppressed
anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth
in A9 mouse fibrosarcoma cells and inhibited tumor formation in
nude mice (16).
H37’s involvement in malignancy has been explored by other
investigators as well, with results consistent to our findings. For
example, H37 was identified as one of the serum antigens reacting
with autologous antibody in renal cancer patients (17). H37/Luca15
is down-regulated in human schwannomas (18) as well as in rastransformed
Rat-1 rat embryonic fibroblastic cells (19). Ectopic
expression of the H37 gene also suppresses growth of HT 1080
human fibrosarcoma cells (19). Several alternatively spliced transcripts
from the H37 locus, and an antisense fragment, seem to
function as apoptotic regulators in hematopoetic cells (20–24). In
particular, growth inhibition by the full-length H37 correlated with
higher apoptotic rates and G1 cell cycle arrest in CEM-C7 human T
cells (24). Most significantly, the H37/RBM5 gene was included in
the 17 common gene signature associated with metastasis (one of
the nine genes down-regulated in metastases) identified in multiple
solid tumor types (25). Solid tumors carrying this gene expression
signature had high rates of metastasis and poor clinical outcome
(25). The fact that H37 shows tumor inhibitory properties in
multiple different tissues is consistent with the finding that 3p21 is
deleted in multiple other tumor types (although not as frequent as
in the lung cancer), suggesting that this 3p21.3 TSG may be a
general TSG (1).

Taken together, these data suggest that the H37 gene plays a
significant role in tumor formation. However, tumor suppression
by H37 has never been shown, systematically, in the tissue where
H37 TSG would presumably be the most important (the lung).
Therefore, there remains the need to develop an appropriate lung
cancer model to thoroughly test H37 tumor suppression and
investigate the physiologic function(s) of H37 and its molecular
mechanism of tumor suppression in the most relevant/appropriate
tissue type. To this end, we have developed a lung cancer cell line
model in which H37 is ectopically expressed. By using this cell
system, we have confirmed tumor suppressive activity of H37 in the
lung and begun to characterize the molecular mechanism/
biochemical pathways for H37’s tumor suppression.

Materials andMethods

Cell culture. A549 cells were purchased from the American Tissue Type
Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/L glutamine, and 1% penicillin
G/streptomycin/fungizone solution.
Plasmid transfection and generation of stable H37 transfectants.
The full-length H37 cDNA was subcloned in the pBK-CMV eukaryotic
expression vector. The plasmid was transfected into cells by LipofectAMINE
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After
selection in G418 (700 Ag/mL) for 2 weeks, cells were plated into 10-cm
dishes at limiting cell dilutions. Single cells that grew into individual
colonies were removed from the dish by cell scraping and transferred into a
six-well plate. Each cell line was then expanded and tested for H37
expression. The transfected cells were strictly maintained in the same
concentrations of G418 to avoid reversion of the cells.
Cell counts and soft agar assay. Cells were plated in triplicate in sixwell
plates (5,000 per well). After plating (day 0), seeding density was
measured at day 1, and cells were counted at days 3, 5, and 7 by Coulter cell
counter. For soft agar assay, cells were plated in 0.5% (bottom) and 0.3%
(top) soft agar layers, in triplicate, in 35-mm dishes (20,000 per dish) and
were incubated for up to 2 weeks before counting and photography.
Colonies with >20cells were counted.
Cell cycle analysis. Cells (1  106
) were harvested and washed in cold
PBS followed by fixation in 70% alcohol for 30 minutes on ice. After washing
in cold PBS three times, cells were resuspended in 0.8 mL of PBS solution
with 40 Ag of propidium iodide and 0.1 Ag of RNase A for 30minutes at
37jC. Samples were analyzed for DNA content by FACSCalibur (Becton
Dickinson, San Jose, CA) using blue 488-nm laser for excitation and fl2
detector 585 F 21 nm for emission.
Hoechst staining for apoptotic cell nuclei. Cells grown in four-well
chamber slides (8,000 per chamber) were fixed in Carnoy’s Fixative (one
part glacial acetic acid to three parts absolute methanol; MP Biochemicals,
Irvine, CA) and subsequently stained with Hoechst 33258 (0.05 Ag/
mL) in HBSS (MP Biochemicals). The cells were observed under a
fluorescence microscope, and blue cells with apoptotic nuclear characteristics,
such as nuclear condensation and fragmentation, were scored as
apoptotic. Results are expressed as the percentage of the number of
apoptotic cells compared with the total number of cells in 10random
0.159-mm2 fields.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase–mediated nick end labeling
staining. The assay was done using the In situ Cell Death Detection kit,
Fluorescein (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions for adherent cell preparations. A terminal
deoxynucleotidyltransferase–mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) reaction
mixture without terminal transferase served as a negative control. For a
positive control, permeabilized cells were incubated with DNase I for 10
minutes at 15jC to 25jC to induce DNA strand breaks before labeling
procedures. Cells plated onto microscope slides were air-dried and fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) for 1 hour, then incubated in 0.1%
Triton X-100 with 0.1% sodium citrate on ice for 2 minutes. Fifty microliters
of the TUNEL reaction mixture containing fluorescein-dUTP and terminal

deoxynucleotidyl transferase were added to the cells with subsequent
incubation in a humidified chamber for 60minutes at 37jC in the dark.
Apoptotic cells exhibiting a strong nuclear green fluorescence were detected
using a standard fluorescein filter (520nm). To quantify the apoptotic
events, the number of cells undergoing apoptosis was counted in ten 0.159-
mm2 fields and expressed as a percentage of the total number of tumor cells
in the same field.
Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was done according to the
standard protocol (26). Antibodies for the cell cycle–related proteins were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and all the
antibodies for apoptotic pathways were purchased from BD Biosciences
(San Jose, CA).
Bax knockdown by small interfering RNA. The SMARTpool small
interfering RNA (siRNA; Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) for Bax was used,
which contains a mixture of four siRNA duplexes selected by the
SMARTselection algorithm by the manufacturer. The siRNA transfection
was done using the DharmaFECT1 transfection reagent (Dharmacon)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, A549 cells were
seeded in 24-well plates (1.25  104 in 0.5 mL per well) in antibiotic-free
growth media 1 day before the transfection. For transfection, the growth
media was replaced with the 500 AL of the transfection mixture (per well)
containing 50pmol siRNA and 2 AL DharmaFECT1 in the Opti-MEM I–
reduced serum medium (Invitrogen). The transfection medium was
replaced with the complete growth medium 24 hours after the
transfection. The cells were harvested 96 hours after the transfection for
the Bax expression analysis by Western blot and cell counts and TUNEL
assays. Appropriate controls (all from Dharmacon) were used as follows:
siGlow and siTox (positive transfection controls), siGAPDH (positive
knockdown control), and siNon-Targeting Pool (negative control).
Mitochondrial membrane potential breakdown assay. Cells were
seeded in four-well chamber slides 24 hours before staining. Cells were
stained with the JC-1 reagent (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and incubated in
the tissue culture incubator for 15 minutes according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. JC-1 aggregates in the mitochondria (only in
live cells) were detected as the red color by a fluorescence microscope at
excitation/emission = 540/570 nm; JC-1 monomers in the cytosol (in both
live and apoptotic cells) were detected as green at excitation/emission =
490/520 nm.
Cytochrome c release assay. Cell fractionation was done by using the
cytochrome c release apoptosis assay kit (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, the cell pellet (5  107 cells)
was resuspended in 1 mL cytosol extraction buffer mix containing DTT and
protease inhibitors, incubated on ice for 10minutes, and disrupted with 30to
50passes of a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at
700  g to separate the pellet containing the nuclei, unbroken cells, and large
membrane fragments from the supernatant containing cytosolic fraction.
The pellet was resuspended in 0.1 mL mitochondrial extraction buffer mix to
obtain mitochondrial fraction; 10 Ag of each cytosolic and mitochondrial
fraction was subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and Western blot
analysis with the monoclonal cytochrome c antibody.
Caspase-9 and caspase-3 activity assays. Caspase-9 activity was
analyzed using a fluorometric assay kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the cell pellet (1  106
cells) was lysed in the lysis buffer on ice. After protein standard assay, 50 AL
of cell lysate containing 125 Ag of protein and the reaction buffer was
pipetted into a 385-well plate. Subsequently, 5 AL of caspase-9 fluorogenic
substrate [LEHD peptide conjugated to 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin
(AFC)] was added to each reaction well. After 1 hour of incubation at
37jC, the plate was read in a fluorescence microplate reader (Flexstation II,
Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at 400 and 505 nm excitation and
emission wavelengths, respectively.
Caspase-3 activity was analyzed using a fluorometric immunosorbent
enzyme assay kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, caspase-3 from cellular lysates (2  106 cells) was
captured by a monoclonal anti-caspase-3 antibody precoated to the
microtiter plate. Following the washing step, added substrate (Ac-DEVDAFC)
was cleaved proportionally to the amount of activated caspase-3.

Results

Screening of multiple adherent lung cancer cells for the H37
protein expression and the H37 gene transfection. Prior
experiments designed to ectopically express H37 in lung cancer
cells, which were deleted at 3p21.3, were limited due to the cell line
availability (16). The NCI-H740cells would have been an ideal
model system to test because both copies of 3p21.3 are deleted.
However, they grow in suspension and are difficult to maintain in
culture. Thus, we were only able to show H37’s growth inhibition to
a limited extent (16) because we could not grow the cells on soft
agar for anchorage-independent growth assay nor generate stable
transfectant cell clones to further characterize biochemical pathways
of H37 tumor suppression. As an alternative strategy, we
screened multiple adherent lung cancer cell lines to compare H37
protein expression levels. We found that among seven commonly
used adherent lung cancer cell lines, A549 cells have the lowest H37
protein expression by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A). These cells
were used as parental cells for H37 transfection using pBK-CMV
plasmid expression vector. Both transiently (3 days after transfection)
and throughout the 2-week selection in neomycin, the H37
transfectants showed consistent growth retardation compared with
the vector controls (Fig. 1B). The A549/H37 cells grew to only 20%
of the control cells at the end of the 2-week selection period
(data not shown). Morphologically, examination of the control
cells revealed organized, tightly packed, uniform-shaped cancer cell
colonies with a ‘‘cobblestone’’ appearance, whereas the H37 cells
displayed an irregular, disorganized array of colonies consisting of
flattened giant cells with cytoplasmic extensions (Fig. 1B). This
disordered cell feature has been reported to be related to TSG
transfections with other genes, including p53 (27).
Generation of stable clones and cell proliferation assays. To
generate stable transfectants with defined levels of H37 expression,
numerous single transfected cells were expanded to cell clones. As
expected, these cells were difficult to propagate due to the growth
inhibition induced by H37. A total of 28 H37 clones and 12 control

clones were generated, and H37 expression levels in each clone
were analyzed by Western blot analysis. H37 expression levels from
two representative H37 clones (hereafter called H1 and H2) and
two control clones (hereafter called C1 and C2) are shown in
Fig. 2A. To measure proliferation rates, growth curves were
generated for each clone over a 1-week period. By day 7, growth of
H1 and H2 cells was reduced by 78% and 72%, respectively,
compared with the average control level. In addition, significantly
reduced numbers (as well as size) of the soft agar colonies resulted
from H37 transfection in an anchorage-independent growth assay
(Fig. 2C). The numbers of H1 and H2 colonies were reduced by 69%
and 76%, respectively, compared with the average control levels
(Fig. 2C). Subsequently, growth inhibition of the H37-overexpressing
A549 cells were further evaluated by s.c. injection into nude
mice. In contrast to the control cells that formed relatively large
tumors within a short period of time, animals injected with H37.1
and H37.2 cells exhibited almost complete inhibition of tumor
formation (Fig. 2D).
Analysis of cell cycle alterations induced by H37. We next
explored the mechanisms underlying growth inhibition by H37. The
lack of growth in H37 transfectants may result from cell cycle
effects, cell death, or a combination of the two processes. The cell
cycle distribution of cells transfected with control vectors or H37
was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of
propidium iodide–stained cells, a measure of DNA content. As
shown in Fig. 3A, H37 clones showed a higher proportion of cells in
G0-G1 phase (69.44% and 61.71% for H1 and H2, respectively),
compared with control cells (50.73% and 49.67% for C1 and C2,
respectively), and a concomitant decrease in the proportion of cells
in S phase (22.32% and 25.28% for H1 and H2, respectively) relative
to that observed in controls (39.11% and 37.51% for C1 and C2,
respectively).
Analysis of apoptosis induced by H37. To determine the
contribution of cell death to H37-induced reductions in cell growth,
we employed two different methods to detect apoptotic cells:
Hoechst staining and TUNEL labeling. Hoechst staining, by
fluorescence detection, enables more direct visualization of apoptotic
cells, which undergo compaction and fragmentation
of the nuclear chromatin, shrinkage of the cytoplasm, and loss of

Figure 1. A, screening of multiple adherent lung cancer cell lines for H37 protein expression. Seven lung cancer cell lines were compared for H37 protein
expression levels by Western blot analysis. Experiments were done with either whole cell or purified nuclear extracts (i.e., H37 is a nuclear protein;ref. 16), and
the consistent results were obtained from both types (shown here is a data obtained from nuclear extract). The polyclonal recombinant H37 antibody used here is
previously described (16). A549 cells were chosen for the H37 plasmid transfection. Nucleoporin expression was used as a protein loading control. B, H37 transfection
into A549 cells and comparison of colony growth and morphology between H37 transfectants and vector control cells. The H37 containing plasmid (pBK-CMV/H37)
was transfected into A549 cells, and growth rate and morphology were compared between the H37 and the vector control cells. Photographs taken at the end of the
2-week selection in G418 (700 Ag/mL) and immediately before generation of single-cell expanded clonal populations. Whereas the control cells exhibit characteristic
features of cancer cell colonies, including a tightly packed, uniform-shaped ‘‘cobblestone’’ appearance, the H37 cells show changes observed with TSGs, such as
disorganized colonies of flattened giant cells with cytoplasmic extensions.

membrane asymmetry. As shown in Fig. 3B, condensed and
fragmented nuclei were more frequently observed in H37-transfected
cells and were only rarely seen in the control cells (f3.5-fold
increase in the H37 cells compared with the control). These
findings were confirmed by TUNEL assay, in which labeled uridine
bases are attached to the DNA nicks characteristic of apoptotic
cells showing green fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 3C, approximately
three times more of the H37 cells were apoptotic compared
with the control cells. In addition, most of the cells counted
apoptotic showed stronger intensity of green in the H37 cells.
Analysis of cell cycle– and apoptosis-regulated proteins in
association with H37 overexpression. To investigate potential
molecular mechanisms for H37-induced cell cycle alterations and
apoptosis, we examined the effects of H37 on cell cycle and
apoptosis regulatory proteins. Whole-cell protein extracts prepared
from either the H37 and/or control A549 cells were analyzed for
protein levels by Western blotting. Although a spectrum of cell

cycle regulatory proteins was tested, including p53, pRB, cyclins A,
B, C, D1, D2, D3, and E, p21, p27, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2),
cdk4, and cdk7/CAK, we detected noticeable changes in only two
proteins, cyclin A and hyperphosphorylated RB, both of which were
down-regulated in H37 cells (Fig. 3D). There were no marked
changes in expression level in any of the other proteins tested (data
not shown). Both cyclin A and hyperphosphorylated RB function in
progressing cells from G1 to S phase, and a decrease expression of
these proteins is consistent with the G1 arrest induced by H37.
Similarly, of a large number of apoptosis regulatory proteins tested
(p53, Bad, Bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-x, caspase-2, caspase-3, caspase-7, DFF45,
FADD, Fas, PARP, Apaf-1, and CAS), we observed a significant
alteration in only one protein, the proapoptotic protein Bax. Its
expression was increased significantly in the H37 cells (Fig. 3D).
Bax, downstream of p53, promotes apoptosis by triggering caspases
cascades in apoptotic pathways, and its increased expression in
H37 cells is consistent with increased apoptotic rates in H37 cells.

H37 transfection into the p53-null lung cancer cells. Our
observation that H37-induced tumor suppression is not associated
with a change in p53 protein expression in A549 cells prompted us to
test a hypothesis that H37 may suppress tumor growth independently
of p53. To this end, we transfected H37 into the H1299 human
NSCLCs (p53 deleted) in parallel with A549 and H460cells (both p53
wild type). Despite lack of p53, H1299 cells, upon H37 transfection,
still manifested reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis

Propidium iodide staining followed by flow cytometry was used to analyze cell cycle distribution. H37 transfection resulted in an increased proportion of cells in the

DNA fragmentation (arrows) as a sign of apoptosis, which is more frequently detected in H37 cells. C, H37-induced apoptosis shown by TUNEL staining. Control
and H37-transfected A549 cells were treated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase to incorporate fluorescein-dUTP to nicked DNA of apoptotic cells. Apoptotic
cells exhibiting a strong nuclear green fluorescence were detected by fluorescence microscopy and compared between the two cell types. Adjacent light microscopic
photos show a representative area from each cell type showing equal cell density and fixation. D, differential expression of the cell cycle and apoptosis regulatory
proteins associated with H37 overexpression. Western blot analysis was done to compare expression levels of various cell cycle– and/or apoptosis-related proteins
between the control and H37-transfected A549 cells. Among them, cyclin A and phospho-RB (cell cycle related) expressions were found to be decreased and Bax
(apoptosis related) increased in the H37 cells compared with the control. h-Tubulin was used as a protein loading control.

Growth Inhibition of Lung Cancer by H37

(Fig. 4A). These changes were comparable with the levels seen in
the A549/H37 and H460/H37 transfectants, although we could not
detect any noticeable change in Bax protein expression in the
H1299/H37 cells in contrast to the A549/H37 and the H460/H37
cells (Fig. 4A). Bax may not be active/functional in H1299 cells
due to lack of its immediate upstream activator, p53, and/or
other potential biochemical alterations associated with p53’s
absence; therefore, H37 may initiate mitochondrial apoptotic
pathway through molecules further downstream of Bax in this cell
line. The possibility still exists that H37- induced change in p53
protein expression level may be too subtle to be detected by
Western blot, or p53 is activated by post-translational modifications
and/or by any other alternative mechanisms in the p53
wild-type A549/H37 and H460/H37 cells. Nonetheless, our
preliminary data showing inhibition of growth by H37 in the
p53- null lung cancer cells may suggest existence of a novel, H37-
mediated apoptotic pathways operating independent of the p53
regulations. It is intriguing to note that the p53-null H1299 has

the highest H37 expression level (Fig. 1A), and investigation of
multiple other p53-null lung cancer cells is warranted.
Analysis of Bax’s biological involvement in H37-mediated
apoptosis using Bax siRNA. To further confirm that Bax plays
a direct functional role downstream of the H37-induced apoptotic
pathway, we employed siRNA knockdown to reverse Bax
expression comparable with the level seen in the A549/control
cells (Fig. 4B). Bax knockdown in A549/H37 cells showed 280%
increase in cell proliferation and 79% decrease in apoptotic rate
compared with the negative control siRNA transfection (Fig. 4B).
These changes are in contrast to the only 68% increase and
29% decrease, respectively, observed in the A549/control cells

knockdown of Bax expression (which was initially induced by
H37) suggests Bax functions biologically in the downstream of
H37 in A549 cells.

apoptotic pathways, we investigated the influence of mitochondrial
apoptosis signaling. Fluorescence microscopy following JC-1
staining revealed breakdown of mitochondrial membrane potential
by H37. As shown in Fig. 5A, decrease in mitochondrial red staining
in the H37 cells (due to loss of JC-1 aggregates in the mitochondria)
indicated reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, and the
number of the cells with intact mitochondrial membrane potential
was shown to be decreased in H1 and H2 by 47% and 43%,
respectively, over the average control level. Thus, the contents of
the inter membrane space, including cytochrome c, were released
into the cytosol in the H37 cells (Fig. 5B). Subsequently,
cytochrome c accumulated in the cytosol-triggered caspase-9
activity, 96% and 83% increase in H1 and H2, respectively, over the
average control level (Fig. 5C). Caspase-9, in turn, activated its
downstream caspase-3, 78.8% and 88.2% increase in H1 and H2,
respectively, over the average control level (Fig. 5D). The activated
caspase-3 is responsible for the cytologic changes characteristic of
apoptosis, including DNA fragmentation. The current data suggest
that although H37’s involvement in the death receptor–mediated
apoptotic pathway remains to be in depth investigated, H37-
mediated growth suppression, at least in part, employs regulation
of mitochondrial apoptotic pathways.

Discussion

The earliest and most common genetic change observed in lungs
of smokers maps to the short arm of chromosome 3, specifically,
3p21.3 (1). This is the region where deletions are observed most
frequently in lung cancer, and occasionally, the whole band is
homozygously deleted. These observations suggest that TSGs
reside at 3p21.3. The fact that specific alterations at this location
can be detected in preneoplastic or preinvasive lesions also
suggests that one or more 3p TSGs may function as ‘‘gatekeepers’’
for initiation of carcinogenesis and hence hold particular promise
as biomarkers as well as potential therapeutic targets. Such
biomarkers could be used to (a) identify individuals at high risk for
lung cancer, (b) diagnose early lung cancer, and (c) assess the
efficacy of lung cancer therapies and chemopreventive agents. In
addition, 3p-linked biomarkers could have prognostic value.
H37/Luca15/RBM5 is among the 35 genes located within the 370-
kb minimal area of deletions at 3p21.3 (14). The current report
represents the first characterization of H37 tumor suppressive
activity in lung cancer cells. The data showed that H37 inhibition of
human lung cancer cell growth involves both interference with cell
cycle progression and induction of apoptosis. Among the various cell
cycle–regulated proteins tested, we have identified decreased cyclin

Figure 5. H37-regulated mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. A, mitochondrial membrane
potential breakdown assay. Control and H37-transfected A549 cells were stained with
the JC-1 reagent and visualized under fluorescence microscopy. Representative areas
each from the control and H37 cells illustrate mitochondrial red staining (JC-1 aggregates)
as a sign of intact, live cells, which is more frequently detected in the control cells, in
contrast to green cytosolic staining (JC-1 monomers) present in both cell types. To
quantify the cells with intact mitochondrial membrane potential, the number of cells with
the mitochondrial red staining was counted in 10 separate fields for each cell type and
expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells in the same field. B, cytochrome c
release assay. Ten micrograms each of membrane (mitochondrial) and cytosolic fractions
from the A549/H37 versus control cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis with
monoclonal anti-cytochrome c. Cytochrome c was detected as a 14.5-kDa band.
The translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 23 (TIM23) and glyceraldehyde3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) protein expressions were used as the protein
loading control for the membrane (mitochondrial) and the cytosolic fractions, respectively.
C, caspase-9 activity assay. Caspase-9 activity was compared in A549/control versus
H37 cells using the caspase-9 fluorogenic substrate LEHD-AFC. The level of caspase-9
enzymatic activity is directly proportional to the fluorescence signal generated by the AFC
fluorescent reporter molecule upon cleavage from the substrate. D, caspase-3 activity
assay. Caspase-3 activity was compared in A549/control versus H37 cells using an
immunosorbent assay. Activated caspase-3, captured by a monoclonal antibody, cleaves
the substrate Ac-DEVD-AFC. Generated free AFC was quantified fluorometrically at 505
nm and determined against a standard curve.

A and phosphorylated RB to be associated with H37 overexpression.
In G1 phase, the cyclin D–dependent kinases initiate Rb phosphorylation,
activating cyclin E for S-phase entry (28). Cyclin E/cdk2 then
completes RB phosphorylation at the G1-S transition, after which
cyclin E is degraded and replaced by cyclin A during the S phase (28).
The data showing H37-induced decreases in cyclin A and phosphoRB
protein expression are consistent with the decreased proportion
of S-phase cells and increased proportion of G1 phase cells observed
in these studies. The precise mechanism by which these events are
achieved remains to be clarified, and studies are in progress to
elucidate the potential signaling pathway(s) involved in H37 growth
inhibition by G1 phase cell cycle arrest.
Apoptosis is a complex, multistage process involving many
genes. Among the wide spectrum of apoptosis regulatory proteins
tested in our studies, the proapoptotic protein Bax was found to be
overexpressed in H37-overexpressing lung cancer cells, with
concomitant triggering of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathways,
including caspase-9 and caspase-3 activations. A major regulation
of the apoptotic death signal resides with the bcl-2/bax genes, the
former an apoptosis-suppressing and the latter an apoptosispromoting
protein (29). Bax and Bcl-2 can form heterodimers, and
overexpression of one antagonizes the other’s effect; p53 functions,
in part, by regulating the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. In our studies, bcl-2
expression was not changed in the H37 cells. Thus, H37 expression

may result in increased bax protein expression, leading to an
increased apoptotic rate.
In an attempt to understand further the cellular/molecular
functional mechanism of the H37-mediated tumor suppression, we
have recently done computational algorithms to search for the
transcription factor binding sites commonly present in the H37 gene
promoter across species. Among those predicted to be true
transcription factor binding sites was for the ZNF143/STAF protein,
a transcription factor for eight different vertebrate small nRNA genes
that function in RNA processing, such as splicing and polyadenylation
(30, 31). This finding, although it needs to be validated by
actual experiments, such as a gel-shift assay, is in a good correlation
with the previous observations that the H37 protein contains
RNA-binding motifs (i.e., RBM5 is another name for H37/Luca15;
refs. 15, 32), and H37 shows in vitro RNA-binding activity (33). Taken
together, our current hypothesis is that H37 may function in some
aspects of post-transcriptional regulations of certain important
proteins involved in cell cycle and/or apoptosis (i.e., Bax, cyclin A,
RB, etc.). Based on this idea and in summary of our current findings,
here, we propose a putative model for the molecular/cellular
mechanism of the H37-mediated tumor suppression (Fig. 6). In this
model, the RNA-binding protein H37 may directly interact with
mRNA transcripts of certain important regulatory proteins involved
in tumor formation, either stabilizing tumor-suppressing genes

Figure 6. A proposed model summarizing the role of H37 in tumor suppression. The proposed model suggests that the H37 protein (illustrated as the red circles) with
RNA binding capacity may participate in one or more different processes in post-transcriptional regulation pathways (i.e., RNA splicing, polyadenylation, message
stability, mRNA transport, protein translation, etc.). H37, depending on either the ‘‘activating’’ or ‘‘inhibitory’’ binding (to RNA transcripts), may facilitate or impede
generation of proteins (i.e., Bax or cyclin A, respectively) involved in tumor suppression or any other unknown proteins (illustrated as a question mark within the circles)
upstream of either apoptotic (Bax) or cell cycle (cyclin A) pathways.

(i.e., Bax) and/or destabilizing tumor-promoting genes (i.e., cyclin A;
Fig. 6). The RNA-binding proteins control mRNA stability and
translation of the specific target mRNAs through a complex network
of RNA/protein interactions. HuR, mdm-2, and VHL are only the few
examples of an ever-increasing number of RNA-binding proteins
carrying out important functions in cancer (34). Identification of the
specific mRNA targets of H37 and/or its RNA-protein complex
warrants future investigations.
The A549/H37 versus control cell pair system may be further
used to examine H37’s role in various physiologic pathways (e.g.,
transformation prevention, growth signal transduction, differentiation,
genomic stability, and DNA damage response). This
system may also be used for identifying downstream target
molecules involved in the H37 growth suppression pathway. The
genes differentially expressed in association with H37 growth
inhibition are being studied by microarray analyses comparing the
two cell populations differing only in H37 expression level, and we
hope that these data will yield better insights into the cellular
function of H37. The isogenic cell paired system may also be used
to identify H37 protein partners or to validate the found partners

by the yeast two-hybrid screening, which is currently under way.
However, the most rigorous test of validating H37 as a bona fide
tumor suppressor could come from generation of H37 knockout
mice, and these studies are currently in progress.
In sum, the current studies provide a foundation to further
explore the role of H37 in lung cancer pathogenesis and suggest a
strategy for the development of rationally designed therapeutics
using H37 as a target.
