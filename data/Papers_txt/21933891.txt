Abstract
Purpose: The transcription factor c-Myc (or "Myc") is a master regulator of pathways driving cell growth
and proliferation. MYC is deregulated in many human cancers, making its downstream target genes
attractive candidates for drug development. We report the unexpected finding that B-cell lymphomas from
mice and patients exhibit a striking correlation between high levels of Myc and checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1).
Experimental Design: By in vitro cell biology studies as well as preclinical studies using a genetically
engineered mouse model, we evaluated the role of Chk1 in Myc-overexpressing cells.
Results: We show that Myc indirectly induces Chek1 transcript and protein expression, independently
of DNA damage response proteins such as ATM and p53. Importantly, we show that inhibition of Chk1,
by either RNA interference or a novel highly selective small molecule inhibitor, results in caspasedependent
apoptosis that affects Myc-overexpressing cells in both in vitro and in vivo mouse models of
B-cell lymphoma.
Conclusion: Our data suggest that Chk1 inhibitors should be further evaluated as potential drugs against
Myc-driven malignancies such as certain B-cell lymphoma/leukemia, neuroblastoma, and some breast and
lung cancers. Clin Cancer Res; 17(22); 7067–79. 2011 AACR.

Introduction

The MYC family of proto-oncogenes encodes 3 different
transcription factors, c-Myc (hereafter Myc), N-Myc, and
L-Myc, which are functionally similar. They regulate a vast
number of genes involved in most aspects of cell growth and
proliferation (1), explaining the selection for mutations
that result in overexpression of Myc proteins in the majority
of human cancers. However, Myc overexpression can be
sensed as oncogenic stress in cells, which manifest as
apoptosis or senescence (2, 3). This cellular defense against
Myc-induced transformation involves apoptotic mediators,
cell-cycle proteins, and tumor suppressors such as Arf, ataxia
telangiectasia mutated (ATM), and p53 (4). As a consequence,
these categories of genes are often deregulated
during tumorigenesis, unleashing the oncogenic functions
of Myc.

Myc binds proteins in the prereplication complex and
independent of its role as a transcription factor causes
replication stress and DNA damage by excessive stimulation
of replication fork firing (5, 6). This can trigger a DNA
damage response (DDR), a process that depending on insult
engages one or more of the proximal phosphoinositide3-kinase–like
proteins ATM, its related kinase ataxia telangiectasia
and Rad3-related protein (ATR), and DNA-dependent
protein kinase (DNA-PK). These kinases then initiate a
signal transduction pathway feeding down to p53 that
regulates the cell cycle or apoptosis depending on cell
context (7).
Activation of p53 by the DDR causes a prolonged cellcycle
arrest in either the G1 or the G2 phase of the cell cycle.
Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) kinase, which is also activated
via phosphorylation by ATM/ATR kinases (8), mediates a
faster response and is known to play an important role in
DNA damage checkpoint control, embryonic development,
and tumor suppression (9). Activation of Chk1 occurs in
response to improper DNA replication and various forms of
genotoxic stress (8, 10). Chk1 then inactivates members of
the Cdc25 family, which control cell-cycle transitions by
dephosphorylating cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk; ref. 11).
In addition, Chk1 also phosphorylates proteins involved in
stabilization of replication forks (12) and spindle checkpoint
function (13).
Checkpoints in G2 and M phase provide protection
against a premature and lethal mitotic entry in case
of damaged DNA. Tumors often exhibit genomic instability,
making them very sensitive to disturbances in

checkpoints, despite the fact that they might themselves
have arisen because of checkpoint overrides. It thus seems
that a low level of checkpoint override (e.g., Chek1 haploinsuffiency)
may be tumor promoting (9), whereas a
high level of genomic instability (e.g., Chk1 inhibition)
can be therapeutically beneficiary (14). Along the same
line, we and others have recently shown that Myc overexpression
selectively sensitizes cells to checkpoint override
following inhibition of its transcriptional targets and
mitotic regulators Cdk1 and Aurora B kinases (15, 16).
Here, we report a novel and unanticipated connection
between Myc and Chk1. Our findings suggest that Chk1 is
essential for Myc to provoke illegitimate cell-cycle progression
and suggest a novel therapeutic avenue against
Myc-overexpressing tumors such as lymphomas, breast
and lung cancers, and neuroblastoma.

Materials and Methods

Materials
Primary antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Chk1, ER, Myc, and p19Ink4d), Sigma (b-actin
and tubulin), Upstate (gH2AX), and Cell signalling (caspase-9).
Horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antibodies
against mouse and rabbit antibodies were from GE Healthcare
Life Sciences.
Decitabine (5-aza-20
-deoxycytidine or Dacogen) was generously
provided by MGI Pharma. The pan-caspase inhibitor
Q-VD-OPH was obtained from BioVision.

Synthesis and evaluation of a selective Chk1 inhibitor
The Chk1 inhibitor "Chekin" was made in a structure–
activity relationship series of position 8 of compound 2
described in a previous publication (17). Detailed description
of the synthesis and the structure–activity relationship
is presented elsewhere (18). Kinase assays in Table 1 were
conducted as previously described (19). The selectivity of
Chekin was further determined by a time-resolved fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay on the
basis of the LanthaScreen Method (Invitrogen). Individual
kinases (2–10 nmol/L) or probes (2 Kd of probe to the
particular kinase; range of 6.25–200 nmol/L) were either
manufactured in-house (Abbott Laboratories) or purchased
from Invitrogen (kinases/probes) or CarnaBio (kinases).
The inhibitor was tested across the range of 0.0001 to
10 mmol/L in a 10-fold dilution dose response. The control
inhibitor staurosporine was used to assess the accuracy and
precision of the system.

Cell culture
293T human kidney cells and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were
from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in

Translational Relevance

The idea of using checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) inhibitors
to treat cancer came from the observations that
tumor cells get rid of DNA damage checkpoints during
tumorigenesis or therapy, making them highly sensitive
to additional genomic instability. By combining chemotherapy
or radiotherapy with Chk1 inhibitors, tumors
would be more sensitive than the normal surrounding
cells. Here, we identify a possible means to stratify
patients into groups that may benefit particularly well
from the inclusion of Chk1 inhibitors in their treatment
regimens. We also show efficacy of a novel Chk1 inhibitor,
which could serve as the lead for the development of
such treatments.

Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium with 10% fetal calf
serum (FCS), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 1 mmol/L sodium
pyruvate, and antibiotics. Human lymphoma cell lines
P493-6, Akata, BJAB, DG75, KemI, and Raji were laboratory
stocks and were cultured at a density between
105 and 106 cells per milliliter in RPMI-1640 medium
with 10% FCS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 50 mmol/L b-mercaptoethanol,
0.1875% sodium bicarbonate, and antibiotics.
Mouse lymphoma cell lines established from
tumors arising in either the l-Myc or Em-Myc transgenic
mice (15, 20) were cultured at a density between 105 and
106 cells per milliliter in RPMI-1640 medium with 5%
FCS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 50 mmol/L b-mercaptoethanol,
0.1875% sodium bicarbonate, and antibiotics.
Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) were generated from
E13.5-E15 embryos from timed matings between p53
heterozygous mice according to established methodology.
All experiments were repeated with multiple MEF
isolates.

Viral infections
Retroviruses were made by calcium phosphate–mediated
cotransfection of 293T cells with pBABE-HrasG12V-puro,
MSCV-IRES-puro, or MSCV-IRES-GFP (with or without
c-Myc or MycER) together with pCL-Eco (all from
Addgene). Twenty-four hours posttransfection, media was
changed and supernatants were harvested 4 times during 36
hours, filtered and used to infect p53/ MEFs and bone
marrow–derived B cells, or NIH 3T3 cells in the presence of
4 or 8 mg/mL polybrene, respectively. Cells infected with
MSCV-IRES-puro–based retroviruses were selected in the
presence of 4 to 6 mg puromycin.
Lentiviral infections were made by calcium phosphate–
mediated cotransfection of 293T cells with packaging plasmids
pCMV-dR8.2dvpr and pHCMV-Eco (Addgene) using
5 different MISSION short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs
(Sigma) per gene directed against the Chek1, ATM, ATR, and
Prkdc (encoding DNA-PK) mouse mRNA. Twenty-four
hours posttransfection, media was changed and supernatants
were harvested 4 times during 36 hours and used to
infect target cells. Mouse lymphoma cells were infected by 3
rounds of spinoculation (20 minutes at 50  g) during 24
hours in the presence of 2 mg/mL polybrene. MEFs or NIH
3T3 cells were infected by culturing the cells in the presence
of viral particles and 4 to 8 mg/mL of polybrene. The cells
were selected by culturing in the presence of 2 to 6 mg/mL
puromycin.

Cell-cycle and apoptosis analyses
For cellular staining with propidium iodide (PI), mouse
and human B cells were collected by centrifugation, and
adherent cell cultures were gently detached from the dish
with trypsin-EDTA and then collected by centrifugation
together with its original culture supernatant. The cells were
resuspended and incubated in Vindelov’s reagent (10
mmol/L Tris, 10 mmol/L NaCl, 75 mmol/L PI, 0.1% Igepal,
and 700 U/L RNase adjusted to pH 8.0) with a cell concentration
not exceeding 106 cells per mL. The PI-stained

cells were then analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences) using the FL3 channel in a linear scale for
cell-cycle distribution. Apoptosis was determined on the
basis of the number of cells that carried less than diploid
DNA content (sub-G1) in a logarithmic FL2 channel.

Western blot analysis
Cell pellets or tumors crushed in liquid nitrogen were
lysed, and the debris was removed by centrifugation. A total
of 30 to 50 mg protein per lane was separated on SDS-PAGE
gels and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes
(Schleicher-Schuell). Membranes were stained with
Ponceau S red dye to verify equal loading. All subsequent
steps were carried out in TBS-Tween (10 mmol/L Tris-HCl,
pH 7.6, 150 mmol/L NaCl, and 0.05% Tween-20) either
containing 5% milk (blocking and antibody incubations)
or 2% bovine serum albumin (phospho-specific antibody
incubations). Antibody binding was visualized by
enhanced chemiluminescence with the SuperSignal West
Dura or Pico reagents from Pierce and either an X-ray film or
a LAS4000 imaging system (Fujifilm Life Science). In the
Figures, images with a dark tone are generated by autoradiography
and those with a light tone are generated with the
LAS4000 system.

RNA preparation and analysis
RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) or
NucleoSpin RNA II (Macherey-Nagel). cDNA synthesis was
carried out on 1-mg RNA by iScript first strand synthesis kit
(Bio-Rad). Quantitative PCR using gene-specific primers
was carried out by the KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Kit (Kapa
Biosystems) on an iCycler iQ5 real-time PCR machine (BioRad).
Relative mRNA levels were calculated with the DDCt
method.

Histology and immunohistochemistry
With Institutional Review Board approval, and following
informed consent, paraffin blocks of tumors from Burkitt
lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma
patients were banked. For immunohistochemistry,
2-mm sections were deparaffinized. Antigen retrival was
carried out by pressure cooking in citrate buffer (pH 6) for
7 minutes. Binding of the Chk1 antibody was detected after
an overnight incubation at 4C by the DAKO REAL Detection
Kit (DAKO) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Two
independent operators analyzed n ¼ 3 high-power fields
(HPF; 40) in n ¼ 5 samples of Burkitt lymphoma or
mantle cell lymphoma.

Mouse experiments
All animal experiments were carried out in accordance
with the Regional Animal Ethic Committee Approval #A6-
08 or #A18-08. The p53-knockout mice (21) and ApcMin
mice, both on a C57BL/6 background, were obtained
from the Jackson laboratory. The l-Myc mouse model
(22) was a kind gift from Dr. Georg Bornkamm (GSF,
Munich, Germany). All mice were observed daily for signs
of disease. All moribund mice were immediately sacrificed.

When tumor-bearing mice were sacrificed, tumors and
lymphoid organs were collected for analyses or tissue banking.
Tumors were either snap frozen and/or dispersed into
single-cell suspensions by scalpels and cell strainers.
To develop a p53-deficient Myc-driven in vivo model, we
magnetically sorted bone marrow–derived B cells by labeling
them with an anti-B220-R-PE antibody, followed by
labelling with an anti-PE magnetic microbead and loading
on a MACS column (Miltenyi). The purified B cells were
cultured overnight in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% FCS,
2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 50 mmol/L b-mercaptoethanol,
0.1875% sodium bicarbonate, and antibiotics in the presence
of MSCV-Myc-IRES-GFP retrovirus produced as
described earlier and 4 mg/mL polybrene. Infected cells were
injected into C57BL/6 mice, and tumor development was
monitored. Tumors that developed were dispersed into
single cells and were immunophenotyped to confirm B-cell
origin and frozen down in medium containing 10%
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for banking. For drug experiments,
cells were thawed, and 150,000 cells were intravenously
injected per mouse. After 1 week, Chekin (17 mg/kg;
n ¼ 7) or vehicle (PEG400:chremophore/70% EtOH:saline:
cyclodextrin, 10:50:30:10; n ¼ 8) was injected twice daily
for 4 days after which tumor development was observed. For
acute experiments in C57BL/6 transplanted with lymphoma
cells or in healthy precancerous l-Myc mice, 4 and 3
injections every 12 hours was carried out, respectively, after
which tumors or splenic B cells, respectively, were harvested
and analyzed by Western blot analysis.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using the t test functions
of Excel or GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software).
, P < 0.05 and , P < 0.01 were considered statistically
significant. The bars shown represent the mean of triplicates

Results

Myc regulates Chk1 in vitro
We have previously shown that Myc overexpression sensitizes
p53-deficient cells to DNA damage (17, 23). To study
the role of Myc in checkpoint override in more detail, we
generated p53-null MEFs from E13.5 embryos and transduced
them with a retrovirus engineered to express a fusion
protein between c-Myc and the ligand-binding domain of
the estrogen receptor (ER), the MycER protein. Addition of
the estrogen analogue 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT) to
growth medium releases the MycER protein from binding
to Hsp in the cytoplasm and exposes the nuclearlocalization
signal of Myc to induce nuclear translocation. Activation of
Myc resulted in override of the cell-cycle arrest exerted by

g-irradiation or decitabine, a DNA methyltransferase
inhibitor that also induces DNA damage, resulting in cell
death (data not shown; refs. 17, 23). Detailed analysis of
p53-deficient cells at different time points following Myc
activation and DNA damage surprisingly revealed that
Chk1 is induced by Myc activation, even without prior DNA

damage (Fig. 1A). To investigate at which level Chk1 was
induced by Myc activation, we carried out quantitative
reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) on mRNA from cells
that had been subjected to Myc activation. Interestingly,
Chk1 upregulation upon 4-HT treatment required de novo
protein synthesis, as the translation inhibitor cycloheximide
blocked induction, in contrast to the direct Myc target
Odc (Fig. 1B). This suggests that Myc upregulates Chk1
indirectly. In line with this, the regulatory sequences of the
Chek1 gene was devoid of conserved Myc-binding E-boxes
(data not shown) and had not previously been discovered
in screens for Myc-bound gene regulatory sequences
(www.myccancergene.org). However, the Myc-dependent
upregulation of Chk1 was evolutionarily conserved as
activation of Myc in human P493-6 B cells, which carry a
tetracycline-regulated MYC construct permitting conditional
expression of Myc (24), also resulted in elevated levels
of Chk1 protein (Fig. 1C). In essence, Chk1 expression
correlated with the activation/reactivation of MYC and
the associated increase in Myc protein.
Given that Chk1 has a dual role in promoting and inhibiting
tumorigenesis, we were interested in studying this kinase
in the context of Myc overexpression. Because supraphysiologic
levels of Myc are known to both promote DNA damage,
apoptosis, and tumorigenesis (25), we therefore assessed
whether the induction of Chk1 by Myc was mediated by the
DDR. To test this hypothesis, we carried out shRNA-mediated
knockdown of Atm, Atr, and Prkdc (DNA-PK) in NIH
3T3 cells infected with MycER. qRT-PCR confirmed that
potent knockdown was achieved for Atm and DNA-PK but
to a lesser extent for ATR (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Induction
of Chk1 upon Myc activation occurred normally in cells
with decreased levels of these proximal kinases and their
activity [measured by detection of the phosphorylated form
of H2AX (gH2AX); ref. 26], suggesting either redundancy or
independency of DDR (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig.
S1B). To verify that Myc can induce Chk1 independently of
downstream mediators of oncogenic stress, we also carried
out these experiments in early-passage p53-deficient,
Arf-deficient, or Arf/Atm double-knockout MEFs. Again, Myc
activation caused an upregulation of total Chk1 protein
levels, independent of p53,Arf, orAtmstatus (Supplementary
Fig. S1C). Importantly, checkpoint activation occurred in
these cells, as shown by the inactivating Tyr 15 phosphorylation
of Cdc2 (Supplementary Fig. S1C).

Myc upregulates Chk1 in vivo
Next, we assessed whether Chk1 is a Myc-regulated
gene also in vivo. To this end, we first analyzed l-Myc
transgenic mice which express MYC under the control of
the immunoglobulin l light chain enhancer and develop
mature B-cell lymphomas (22). Splenic B cells from either
precancerous l-Myc mice or wild-type littermates were
magnetically sorted using anti-IgM antibodies. These cells
and palpable lymphomas harvested from sick l-Myc
animals were analyzed for Chk1 transcript and protein
levels. All of the precancerous cells except one and all
lymphomas exhibited high levels of Chk1 than wild-type

control cells (Fig. 2A and B), confirming that Myc induces
Chk1 also in vivo.
Myc is deregulated in the majority of human cancers,
frequently as a downstream event of an activated oncogenic
pathway. There are, however, cancers like Burkitt lymphoma
or neuroblastoma, and less frequently breast and lung
cancer, where a member of the MYC gene family is directly
activated either by translocation or gene amplification (1).
Burkitt lymphoma is characterized by exhibiting 1 of 3
different translocations, which bring MYC on chromosome
8 under the control of enhancers of IgK, IgH, or IgL on
chromosomes 2, 14, or 22 (27). This causes a massive
transcriptional induction of MYC in B lymphocytes, resulting
in apoptosis, hyperproliferation, or transformation. As
shown earlier, Chk1 transcript and protein was induced in
l-Myc transgenic mice, an in vivo model of Burkitt lymphoma.
We therefore next assessed CHEK1/Chk1 expression in
human Burkitt lymphoma samples. By searching the webbased
public database Oncomine (www.oncomine.org),
we found expression profiling studies showing a highly
significant correlation between MYC mRNA expression in
Burkitt lymphoma with that of CHEK1 (Supplementary Fig.
S2A and S2B). To establish this correlation at the protein
level, various lymphoma subtypes including Burkitt lymphoma
were analyzed for Chk1 expression by immunohistochemistry.
Again, samples from patients with Burkitt
lymphoma exhibited a significantly higher level of Chk1-
positive cells than other B-cell lymphoma subtypes (Fig.
2C). Thus, Myc activation is associated with high Chk1
positivity in vivo.
In most colon cancers, mutation of the adenomatous
polyposis coli (APC) gene results in loss of function of the
protein complex that controls degradation of b-catenin.
The outcome of accumulation of nuclear b-catenin is
activation of genes promoting proliferation, including
c-MYC (28). To analyze whether cells with elevated Myc
also would induce Chk1 in this context, we studied
tumorigenesis of heterozygous ApcMin mice. These mice
lose the remaining wild-type Apc allele and develop
spontaneous adenomas in the colon and small intestine
macroscopically visible at around 120 days of age (29). By
comparing expression of Chk1 in normal gut epithelium
with that in adenomas by Western blot analysis, we
observed elevated levels of Chk1 in 4 of 6 tumors
(Supplementary Fig. S3A). Moreover, qRT-PCR analysis
verified a striking correlation between Myc expression and
Chek1 (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
Despite the strong correlation between Chek1 mRNA/
protein expression and a deregulated Myc oncogene, we
could not gain evidence that Myc directly induces Chek1.

Myc Induction of Chk1 Is an Achilles' Heel for Tumor Cells

To test whether Myc regulated another transcription
factor that could in turn induce Chek1, we screened the
Basso lymphoma gene arrays (Supplementary Fig. S2) for
genes encoding transcription factors involved in cellcycle
progression. Interestingly, expression of genes
encoding transcription factors known to regulate S-phase
progression such as MYBL2, MYC, and FOXM1 was very
high in Burkitt lymphoma. These had correlation R
values to CHEK1 of around 0.5, whereas expression of
2 other prominent S-phase regulators, E2F1 and MYBL1,
correlated slightly less to CHEK1 expression (Supplementary
Fig. S2B). This analysis suggests that Myc may
regulate several transcription factors that could induce
CHEK1.

Chk1 is crucial for the survival of Myc-overexpressing
cells in vitro
Having established that Chk1 is regulated by Myc, we
wanted to investigate whether Chk1 is a potential therapeutic
target, or whether it rather acts as a tumor suppressor
to a stress response provoked by Myc overexpression. Chk1
inhibitors are currently evaluated in clinical studies, testing
the hypothesis that Chk1 constraint fortifies the activity of

DNA-damaging agents (30). Indeed, several studies have
shown that Chk1 inhibition, in combination with druginduced
replication stress or DNA damage, severely compromises
tumor cell survival. To investigate the consequences
of Chk1 inhibition in the context of Myc overexpression,
we genetically removed Chek1 mRNA using
shRNA-expressing lentiviruses in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and
low passage p53-deficient MEFs that had been transduced
with MSCV-Myc-IRES-GFP retroviruses (Fig. 3A). Interestingly,
clonogenic survival assays over 10 days showed that
knockdown of Chk1 severely compromised colony formation
of Myc-overexpressing cells, with basically no cells
surviving over this period of time (Fig. 3B). In contrast,
cells infected with a lentivirus carrying a nontargeting
shRNA did not die, but instead showed signs of overgrowth,
suggesting that Myc triggers hyperproliferation which
requires Chk1.
To analyze the consequence of Chk1 loss for Mycinduced
tumorigenesis or tumor maintenance, we analyzed
transformation efficiency of fibroblasts and growth of Mycinduced
lymphomas in vitro and in vivo. Although Mycoverexpressing
NIH 3T3 fibroblasts expressing the nontarget
shRNA potently formed colonies in soft agar, a hallmark

of malignant transformation, no colonies were observed in
the cells expressing the Chek1 shRNA (Fig. 3C). Introducing
the same highly efficient shRNA into a p53 mutant mouse
lymphoma cell line generated from a sick l-Myc mouse (20)
selected against viable cells (data not shown). By infecting
these lymphoma cells with Chek1 shRNA virus that exhibited
intermediate levels of Chek1 knockdown (Fig. 3D), we
were able to generate viable cells. A more detailed analysis of
these Chk1-low cells revealed that they were clearly more
sensitive to DNA damage induced by decitabine treatment
(Fig. 3E), and they developed tumors slower upon transplantation
into syngenic C57BL/6 recipients (Fig. 3F).
Moreover, several of the tumors that did develop had
regained high level expression of Chk1 (Supplementary
Fig. S4), suggesting that they arose from puromycin-resistant
Chk1-normal cells present in a diluted form in the
Chk1-low culture. Taken together, these data strengthen the
hypothesis that Myc requires appropriate levels of Chk1 for
transformation and tumor cell survival. Chk1 therefore

emerges as a potential pharmaceutical target rather than
a tumor suppressor of Myc-induced tumorigenesis.

Small-molecule Chk1 inhibitors induce Chk1
degradation and cell death of Myc-transformed cells
To validate Chk1 as a therapeutic target, we tested the best
compound of a new generation of Chk1 inhibitors developed
by one of us (L.A. Hasvold; Abbott Laboratories). This
compound, named Chekin (Fig. 4A inset), exhibits inhibition
of Chk1 at low nanomolar concentrations and has
shown Chk1 selectivity over 76 kinases tested in in vitro
enzyme assays (Table 1). In one aspect Chekin is unique as
other known selectiveChk1inhibitors alsoinhibit the related
kinase Chk2 or one of the Cdks. Treating a panel of human Bcell
lymphoma lines for 96 hours with Chekin induced an
apoptotic phenotype in Akata and BJAB, whereas DG75 did
not respond at all (Fig. 4A top, Supplementary Figs. S5 and
S6). Raji primarily responded to Chekin by a slower growth
(Supplementary Fig. S5A) and accumulation of cells in late S

Myc Induction of Chk1 Is an Achilles' Heel for Tumor Cells

and G2 phase (Supplementary Fig. S6). KemI was only
weakly affected in growth rate and cell-cycle distribution,
which was further substantiated by a dose–response curve
(Fig. 4A, Supplementary Figs. S5A and S5B and S6). All lines
that were sensitive to Chekin either exhibited endogenous
activation of DDR, as assessed by Western blot analysis of

gH2AX (26), or had strong induction uponChekin treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S5C). Interestingly, total Chk1 protein
levels following treatment were decreased in correlation to
sensitivity to Chekin (Fig. 4A bottom, Supplementary Fig.
S5C), suggesting mechanism-based degradation exerted by
Chekin as reported in other studies using Chk1 inhibitors in

combination with DNA-damaging agents
(31, 32). This decrease is believed to occur via proteasome-mediated
degradation and could indicate that Myc
overexpression can replace DNA damage in the triggering
of degradation upon Chk1 inhibition. Unexpectedly, however,
the protein level of Myc was also decreased in the BJAB
line, a non–Burkittlymphoma line with a MYCamplification
and which is known to lack stabilizing mutations of MYC
(33).

mutations enabling adaptation to cell culture conditions.
For instance, DG75, which did not respond to Chekin by
either slower growth or apoptosis, is known to carry a
biallelic frameshift mutation resulting in absence of proapoptotic
Bax protein expression (34). To analyze the consequence
of Chk1 inhibition on growth of cultured Mycinduced
lymphomas arising in syngenic l-Myc and Em-Myc
transgenic animals, we made use of lines recently developed
(15, 20). Lymphoma lines with either wild-type or mutant
p53 status were treated with Chekin for 48 hours. All of these
cells showed sensitivity to Chk1 inhibition by inducing
apoptosis (Fig. 4B top). This apoptosis was independent
of their respective p53 status but associated with induction
of DNA damage as assessed by the phosphorylation of
Histone H2AX (26). Again, we could observe degradation
of Chk1 and of Myc in Chekin-treated cells (Fig. 4B bottom).
However, as Myc-expressing cells are sensitive to
aggresome formation in response to inhibition of the proteasome
(ref. 35; and data not shown), we were precluded
from treating the cells with proteasome inhibitors during
the full course of Chekin treatment. Nevertheless, treatment
with proteasome inhibitor for the last 3 hours of a 12-hour
Chekin treatment period rescued the Chk1 degradation to a
modest extent (Supplementary Fig. S7A).
Having established that both human and mouse cells
transformed by Myc exhibit sensitivity to Chk1 inhibition,
we wanted to elucidate whether the apoptotic response was
mediated via mitochondria-mediated caspase cleavage. Pretreatment
of a mouse lymphoma cell line with the pancaspase
inhibitor QVD-OPH completely blocked Chekinmediated
apoptosis (Fig. 4C). Western blot analysis
revealed that the inhibition of apoptosis was accompanied
by a reduction in caspase-9 cleavage (Fig. 4D). Therefore,
the activation of executioner caspase-3 (Supplementary Fig.
S7B and S7C) is likely to be mediated by a pathway that
involves mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. However, Chekin
also impacted on cell-cycle progression as the cells grew
slower (data not shown). Moreover, the cells had higher
amount of cells in G1/early S and G2/M phase of the cell
cycle when treated with Chekin while blocking apoptosis
with QVD-OPH, suggesting that the cells died from these
phases (Supplementary Fig. S7D).

Myc sensitizes cells to Chk1 inhibition in vitro
and in vivo
On the basis of the expression patterns described earlier
(Fig. 1 and 2 and Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3), there is a
strong correlation between MYC and CHEK1 expression.
This implies that Myc proteins, more so than other oncogenes,
would sensitize cells to Chk1 inhibition. To test this,
we analyzed sensitivity to Chekin in low passage p53-deficient
MEFs infected with retrovirus constructs engineered to
express either Myc or oncogenic Ras. Both Myc and Rasexpressing
cells induced apoptosis upon treatment with
Chekin, but the Myc-expressing cells showed a higher
degree of sensitivity (Fig. 5A). The level of Chk1 was highest
in Myc-expressing cells, but Ras-transformed cells also
exhibited a higher Chk1 levels than vector control cells

(Fig. 5B). Analyzing Chk1 protein levels following inhibition
revealed that the protein was degraded in a similar
manner as in the Myc-induced lymphomas.
To test whether Myc would sensitize tumor cells to Chk1
inhibition, we transduced the switchable MycER protein
into Ras-induced sarcoma cells that we had previously
developed in tissue culture after they had grown subcutaneously
in mice. Because MycER expression is leaky (36),
resulting in some MycER translocation even without addition
of 4-HT, we were able to test sensitivity to Chekin of
cells expressing medium (Ras), high (MycER) and very high
Myc (MycER plus 4-HT) activity. As seen in Fig. 5C, MycER
sensitized the sarcoma cells to Chekin and addition of 4-HT,
to induce MycER translocation, further stimulated death.
Assessing previously characterized mediators of DNA damage-induced
death revealed that Myc activation caused

gH2AX phosphorylation and reduced levels of the antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 family member Bcl-XL (Fig. 5D). Interestingly,
Bcl-XL was even further downregulated by Chekin in
Myc-expressing cells but not in the Ras sarcoma transduced
with a control retrovirus. In Myc-overexpressing cells, it is
thus likely that the mitochondrial death revealed by caspase
induction (see Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S7) occurs
because of Bcl-XL downregulation.
The ultimate goal with the generation of Chekin was to
develop a potent anticancer drug that could work as a cancer
therapeutic. To evaluate whether Chekin would function in
vivo, we first treated 4-week-old wild-type or l-Myc mice
with Chekin and assessed the effect on the biomarker, Chk1
itself. As expected from Fig. 2A, sorted splenic B cells from
precancerous l-Myc mice exhibited higher levels of Chk1
protein than did B cells from wild-type mice. Reassuringly, B
cells from mice treated with 17 mg/kg 3 times every 12 hours
exhibited lower Chk1 levels 36 hours after the first injection
(Fig. 6A). Confident that we were hitting the target, we
developed a mouse lymphoma model for the assessment of
the anticancer effect of Chekin. By infecting bone marrow–
derived B cells from p53-knockout mice with an MSCV-MycIRES-GFP
virus and then transplanting these into recipient
syngenic C57BL/6 mice, we obtained mice that developed
B-cell lymphomas (as assessed by fluorescence-activated cell
sorting using antibodies directed against the B-cell marker
B220, Supplementary Fig. S8). These lymphomas were
transplanted into new animals that were divided into 2
groups receiving bidaily injections for 5 days of either
vehicle (n ¼ 6) or 17 mg/kg Chekin (n ¼ 7), which was
the highest dose possible to administer without compound
precipitation. After these injections the mice were followed
for signs of disease after which they were sacrificed or treated
again (see later). Interestingly, Chekin was able to induce a
significantly slower disease progress in this very aggressive
lymphoma model (Fig. 6B). Moreover the therapeutic effect
was associated with induction of Chk1 degradation and
induction of DNA damage as assessed by gH2AX (Fig. 6C).
Taken together these data suggest that Myc-overexpressing
cells are sensitive to the new Chk1 inhibitor Chekin which
therefore could serve as a lead for the development of new
anticancer therapies.

Myc Induction of Chk1 Is an Achilles' Heel for Tumor Cells

To summarize, we show that Myc upregulates the expression
of Chk1, and that Chk1 inhibition selectively contributes
to apoptosis of Myc-transformed cells. This synthetic
lethal interaction is p53 independent and therefore represents
an attractive therapeutic approach in malignancies
having Myc involvement.

Discussion

Targeting MYC for therapeutic reasons is conceivable
based on its prevailing activation in cancer and the fact
that Myc inhibition results in tumor regression of oncogene-addicted
tumors, although sparing normal cells (37,
38). Myc proteins are not enzymes though, making the
development of drugs targeting this class of proteins a
challenge that has been undertaken by others but has not
yet proven successful. An alternative approach is therefore
to identify pathways and genes downstream or parallel to
Myc that are druggable. To this end, we and others have
determined the importance of Myc-regulated genes for
Myc-induced lymphomagenesis. Although not all Mycregulated
genes are created equal, products of some genes
encoding polyamine biosynthetic enzymes (39, 40), ribosomal
proteins (41), and mitotic regulators seem to play

important roles in either tumor development or tumor
maintenance.
One would assume that the most important genes of
Myc would be the direct transcriptional targets. However,
we recently identified Aurora kinase B and Cks1 as essential
products of Myc-regulated genes (15, 42). Herein, we
identify Chk1, which is also regulated by Myc at the
transcriptional level, as an additional essential kinase
whose inhibition is synthetic lethal with Myc overexpression.
These studies suggest that the Myc transcriptome
may contain more indirectly regulated genes that remain
to be found and that may encode possible therapeutic
targets against Myc-driven cancer. At the moment, we do
not know whether these genes are regulated by a common
transcription factor downstream of Myc or whether other
modes of regulation are operating. In the case of Chk1,
very little is known about its transcriptional regulation
but reports imply S-phase regulators such as E2F and
FOXM1 transcription factors, as the promoter region of
CHEK1 harbors functional binding sites (43–45). Given
that Myc regulates these transcription factors (www.myccancergene.org),
it is possible that the observed Chek1
mRNA induction by Myc occurs via these or other factors
such as the Myb family of transcription factors. As shown

here, there is a high degree of correlation between MYC,
CHEK1, MYBL2, and FOXM1 and to a lesser degree E2F1.
It is thus plausible that several factors contribute to
CHEK1 expression in a redundant manner, which
requires further studies to dissect.

Chk1 suppresses 2 main apoptotic pathways involving
caspase-2 and -3. Following replication stress, Chk1 is
crucial in blocking caspase-3–mediated apoptosis, independent
of p53 (46). Furthermore, Chk1 also inhibits caspase2–mediated
apoptosis following DNA damage in p53-deficient
zebrafish, a pathway that is both mitochondria and
death receptor independent (47). Although we observed
caspase-3 activation in Chk1-inhibited cells, this does not
answer which of these pathways is operational, perhaps
both are. It is interesting to note, however, that the cells
which survive Chk1 inhibition by Chekin continue to
proliferate at a slower rate, suggesting that apoptosis inhibition
by Chk1 may be uncoupled from cell-cycle functions
of Chk1. Our study here provides a good model system to
study this mechanism, which is important as it may predict
pathways that may be deregulated in a relapse/disease
progression situation following therapeutic Chk1 inhibition
in the clinic. One potential relapse mechanism could
be via the reactivation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members,
which are suppressed by Myc rendering cells sensitive
to Chk1 inhibition and DNA damage (data herein and in
work published previously by 2 of us; ref. 23).
Recently, inducible MycER mouse models showed
that a deregulated level of Myc, corresponding only to
that of mitogen stimulation, was sufficient to trigger
ectopic proliferation and tumorigenesis whereas higher
levels instead trigger activation of the tumor suppressors
Arf and p53 and subsequently apoptosis (25, 48). The
data shown herein suggest that Myc levels also dictate the
level of induction of Chk1 and sensitivity to Chk1 inhibitors.
It is thus tempting to speculate that tumors that
develop in response to MYC translocation or amplification
become "Chk1 addicts," as their expression level of
Myc is so high. By forcing them to inactivate p53 to avoid
apoptosis (4), the cells become dependent on Chk1 for
genomic integrity. We therefore propose that MYC family
members are biomarkers for Chk1 inhibitor–sensitive
tumors, which would include large amount of breast
cancers, lung cancers, neuroblastoma, and lymphoma.
For other tumors, Chk1 inhibition is already considered
for clinical trials as sensitizers to chemotherapy, but so far
the results of trials are not reported.
Chk1 is a crucial gene in vivo, proven by the embryonic
lethality of the Chk1-knockout animals (9, 49), and our
data also show that cells lacking oncogene activation are
hampered in cell division by removing Chk1. Extrapolating
on these data to a potential clinical application of Chk1
inhibitors may foretell side effects that could counteract the
benefits. Here, mouse models can help to guide the strategies
for using Chk1 inhibitors. For instance, conditional
deletion of Chek1 from somatic epithelial cells in the small
intestine was recently shown to induce DNA damage and
genomic instability followed by apoptosis and crypt death
(50). However, Chek1-proficient cells were able to repopulate
suggesting that Chk1 targeted therapy shows non–
tumor-specific side effect in the short term, but that a drug
regime using windows of rest for the patients should get
around this problem. Our newly discovered Myc–Chk1
