Tumour Suppressive Effects of WEE1 Silencing on Breast Cancer Cells

Asian Pac J Cancer Prev, 14 (11), 6605-6611

Introduction

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy
among women affecting more than a million women per
year worldwide (Hortobagyi et al., 2005). Conventional
treatments, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy,
have been used as front line anti-cancer strategies in past
decades. However, those therapies are involved with
toxic side effects, as they do not discriminate effectively
between normal and tumor cells. In contrast, biological
therapies targeting tumor cells focus on molecular and
cellular changes/pathways that are relatively specific
to cancer cells. Such approaches may block molecules
involved in signal transduction, or inhibit tumor cell
invasion or angiogenesis. Some others may target specific
cell cycle components to stop tumor cell proliferation or
push them toward apoptosis (Schlotter et al., 2008). The

Abstract

Background: WEE1 is a G2/M checkpoint regulator protein. Various studies have indicated that WEE1

could be a good target for cancer therapy. The main aim of this study was to asssess the tumor suppressive
potential of WEE1 silencing in two different breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 which carries the wild-type p53 and
MDA-MB468 which contains a mutant type. Materials and Methods: After WEE1 knockdown with specific
shRNAs downstream effects on cell viability and cell cycle progression were determined using MTT and flow
cytometry analyses, respectively. Real-time PCR and Western blotting were conducted to assess the effect of
WEE1 inhibition on the expression of apoptotic (p53) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl2) factors and also a growth marker
(VEGF). Results: The results showed that WEE1 inhibition could cause a significant decrease in the viability of
both MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell lines by more than 50%. Interestingly, DNA content assays
showed a significant increase in apoptotic cells following WEE1 silencing. WEE1 inhibition also induced upregulation
of the apoptotic marker, p53, in breast cancer cells. A significant decrease in the expression of VEGF
and Bcl-2 was observed following WEE1 inhibition in both cell lines. Conclusions: In concordance with previous
studies, our data showed that WEE1 inhibition could induce G2 arrest abrogation and consequent cell death
in breast cancer cells. Moreover, in this study, the observed interactions between the pro- and anti-apoptotic
proteins and decrease in the angiogenesis marker expression confirm the susceptibility to apoptosis and validate
the tumor suppressive effect of WEE1 inhibition in breast cancer cells. Interestingly, the levels of the sensitivity
to WEE1 silencing in breast cancer cells, MCF7 and MDA-MB468, seem to be in concordance with the level of
p53 expression.

development of an effective targeted therapy requires the
identification of a good target, which plays a key role in
cancer cell growth and survival but less affected in normal
cells.
Regulation of the cell cycle is frequently distorted
in human cancer cells which leading to uncontrolled
proliferation. When normal cells are subject to DNA
damage, the checkpoints of cell cycle control induce a
series of DNA repair mechanisms. Several studies have
shown defective G1 checkpoint in many cancer cells,
including breast cancer cells. Such cells depend to a great
extent on the G2 checkpoint for DNA repair mechanisms
(Dixon and Norbury, 2002; Foulkes et al., 2003). That is
why abrogation of the G2 checkpoint could reduce the
time needed to repair sub-lethal DNA damages, motivated
premature mitotic entry and consequent apoptosis. In this
way, targeting G2 repair pathway can be exploited as a

potential anti-cancer strategy in such tumor cells (Bucher
and Britten, 2008).
WEE1, a member of the tyrosine kinase family, is a
G2/M checkpoint regulatory protein that plays a crucial
role in controlling the timing of mitosis under normal
circumstances. Activated WEE1 causes an inhibitory
phosphorylation of CDC2/CDK1 on Tyr15, which
prevents cells from entering mitosis in order to provide
time for DNA repair (Igarashi et al., 1991; Wang et al.,
2004). It has been shown that WEE1 gene silencing causes
G2 arrest abrogation, premature termination DNA repair
and cell death in Glioblastoma (Mir et al., 2010). It was
also reported that inhibition of WEE1 could improve the
effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy to induce DNA
damage in different cancer cells (Bridges et al., 2011;
Carrassa et al., 2012). Suppression of WEE1 in leukemia
cell lines or ex-vivo derived leukemia cells also made the
cells more sensitive to conventional drugs (Tibes et al.,
2012). Recently it was shown that pushing breast cancer
cells through G2 arrest, which results from inhibition or
loss of WEE1, may allow DNA damage to accumulate
and induce programmed cell death in breast cancer cells
(Murrow et al., 2010).
Therefore, WEE1 could be a potential molecular target
for breast cancer treatment. But the basis for this toxicity
in different cell lines needs to be more clarified. Here, to
do more investigation, we modeled to knockdown WEE1
with specific shRNAs and assessed the downstream
effects in the two different breast cancer cells, MCF7,
which carries the wild-type p53 and MDA-MB-468 which
contains a mutant type.

Materials and Methods

Cell lines and Cell culture
MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were purchased
from the National Cell Bank of the Institute Pasteur of
Iran. The cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 (SigmaAldrich,
Honkong, China) medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and contained 100 unit/ml
penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin under standard
conditions (37°C incubator with 95% humidified air and
5% CO2
).

shRNA plasmids and transfection
Plasmids encoding specific shRNA against WEE1
were purchased from Origene Company (Beijing, China).
The sequence of each 29mer shRNA constructs and the
target locations are listed in Table 1. In order to investigate
the effect of WEE1 inhibition on breast cancer cells,
MCF7 and MDA MB-468 cells were transfected with
these plasmids separately and in combination (pooled).
Briefly, 5×105
 cells were transfected with 4µg of each
WEE1 specific shRNA construct separately with 8µL of
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Grand Island, New York,
USA) in a 6 well plate according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. For transfection with pooled shRNAs, 1µg of
each construct was used in combination.

Quantitative real-time PCR
Quantification of gene expression at the mRNA

level was performed using quantitative real-time PCR
(quantitative RT-PCR). Total RNA was extracted from
transfected cells using TRIzol reagent at different time
points (24, 48, and 72h) following transfection. Reverse
transcription to cDNA was performed using Revert AidTM
HMinus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas,
Helsinki, Finland). Real-Time PCR was carried out to
determine the expression levels of target genes using
specifically designed primers and probes (Table 2). Each
sample was normalized based on β-actin expression.

Western blotting
Protein lysates from transfected (24, 48, 72 hours posttransfection)
and untreated cells were prepared using RIPA
lysis buffer (150 mMNaCl, 0.1% SDS, 50 nMTris pH 8.0,
1% TritonX-100, 0.1% DOC). Total cell lysate from each
condition (40µg) was loaded onto 6-12% polyacrylamide
SDS gels and subjected to electrophoresis. Molecular
weight markers (Fermentas, Helsinki, Finland) were run
on each gel for a size reference. Proteins were transferred
onto PVDF membranes (BioRad, Hercules, California,
USA), blocked and probed with primary antibody. After
overnight incubation in 4ºC, the membrane was washed
3 times with wash buffer (PBS containing 0.05% Tween
20) and then probed with secondary antibody for 2 h in
4ºC. All primary and secondary antibodies were diluted
in blocking buffer (1X PBS with 5 % skim milk) to the
suggested concentrations in their datasheets. Protein
bands were visualized using ECL (Thermo SIENTIFIC,
Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) and XAR film (Kodak,
Rochester, New York, USA). The following antibodies
were used: β-actin (ab20272), WEE1 (ab37597), CDC2
(phospho Y15) (ab47594), VEGF (ab46154), p53
(ab1101), Bcl-2 (ab692), goat polyclonal secondary
antibody to rabbit IgG-H&L (HRP-conjugated) (ab6721)
and rabbit polyclonal secondary antibody to mouse IgGH&L
(HRP-conjugated) (ab6728).

at 1000 rpm for 5 min, after which, the supernatant was
aspirated. The cells were re-suspended in 500 µl cold PBS
and 5 µl of RNaseA (Fermentas, Helsinki, Finland) was
added to each tube then staining was performed with 5
µg/ml propidium iodide (PI) (P4170-100MG SIGMA).
Analysis was done on the Becton Dickinson FACS Calibur
using FLOWJO software.

Statistical analysis
The expression levels of target genes were determined
from the ∆Ct and 2-∆Ct formulae. Data were analyzed
with the Mann-Whitney U test to compare the means
of cell viability percentages and also gene expression
levels between transfected and untreated cells. All data
are presented as mean±standard error. A p value of <0.05
was considered statistically significant.

Results

WEE1 gene silencing
The evaluated transfection efficiency using flow
cytometry analysis was about 60% in MCF7 and MDAMB-468.
Quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analysis
showed a reduction in WEE1 expression at both mRNA
and protein levels, 24h post-transfection by WEE1 specific
shRNAs (Figure 1). WEE1 gene expression showed 16%,
63%, 78%, 83% and 84% down regulation after shRNA1,
2, 3, 4 and pooled shRNAs transfection, respectively, in
MCF7 cells compared with control-shRNA (Figure 1A).
In addition, in MDA-MB-468 cells WEE1 transcript levels
were reduced to 12%, 43%, 66%, 79% and 81% in the
conditions, respectively, compared to the control (Figure
1B).
The expression level of phosphorylated CDC2
(p-CDC2) was considered to evaluate the efficiency of
WEE1 silencing, since p-CDC2 is a major determinant of
the DNA damage induced G2 arrest. In both breast cancer
cells, WEE1 inhibition led to decreased level of p-CDC2
(Figure 5). This data suggests that both MCF7 and MDAMB-468
cell lines could be sensitive to the downstream
effects of WEE1 inhibition.

WEE1 inhibition decreased the viability of breast cancer
cell lines
To investigate the effect of WEE1 silencing on the
viability of breast cancer cells, MTT assay was performed.
The shRNA 2, 3, 4 indicated significant inhibitory effects
on cell viability in comparison with the control shRNA,
60 and 90 h post-transfection, in MCF7 (p≤0.02) and

Cell viability assay
The effect of WEE1 silencing on the viability of the
breast cancer cell lines was determined by performing
MTT assays. Cells (15×103
) were seeded in 96 well
plates overnight, transfected with 200ng of each shWEE1
plasmid using 0.4µl Lipofectamine™ 2000 per well
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Media was
replenished with 150µl of tetrazolium bromide solution (5
mg/ml in complete media) at 24, 48, 60 and 96h following
transfection. Plates were incubated in the dark at room
temperature for 4h and subsequently, the supernatant was
removed and the crystal products were dissolved in 150µl
DMSO (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). After an overnight
incubation in the dark at room temperature, colorimetric
evaluation was performed using a spectrophotometer at
490 nm. All MTT measurements were done in replicates of
4 wells and each experiment was carried out in triplicate.
The absorbance at each condition was compared with the
control and the percentage of viable cells was calculated
based on the following formula: % cell growth=(OD490
transfected/OD490 untreated)×100

DNA content assay
Cells (5×105
) were plated in 6 well plates overnight
and then transfected with combination of 4 specific shRNA
plasmids against WEE1 (pooled) and the control plasmid
separately using 8µl Lipofectamine™ 2000 for each well.
They were trypsinized and washed with cold PBS after 24,
48 and 60 h post-transfection. Then, 1 ml cold ethanol 75%
was added to the cell plate drop by drop to fix them. The
cells were incubated for10 min at -20ºC and centrifuged

MDA-MB-468 cells (p≤0.05), respectively. The highest
percentage of viability reduction was 50% upon WEE1
silencing using pooled shRNAs (Figure 2). WEE1
shRNA1 had no significant effect on viability of both
breast cancer cell lines which probably was not functional.

WEE1 gene silencing induced cell-cycle arrest abrogation
and cell death in breast cancer cells
As WEE1 is a gatekeeper of the DNA damage-induced
G2 arrest which controls mitotic entry of the cells, we
investigated the effect of WEE1 inhibition on the cell
cycle profile of breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and MDAMB-468,
using propidium iodide (PI) staining by FACS
analysis (Figure 3A). Results summarized in Figure
3B show that the population of cells with sub-G1 DNA
content (which is indicative of apoptosis) increased up to
2 fold 48 h and 60 h following WEE1 silencing in MCF7
and MDA-MB-468 cells, respectively. The 50% reduction
in the fraction of cells in G2 phase, indicate that WEE1
silencing could significantly abrogate G2 arrest in both
cell lines and push them toward premature mitosis.

WEE1 inhibition induced up-regulation of p53 (apoptotic
marker) and down-regulation of Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic
marker)
p53 is a nuclear transcription factor which transactivates
many target genes involved in the cell cycle arrest
induction or apoptosis (Chen et al., 1990). We investigated
the effect of WEE1 inhibition on the expression of p53 at
the both mRNA (Figure 4) and protein (Figure 5) levels
in transfected MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cells. The results
showed that the expression level of p53 significantly
increased in transfected cells after 48 h (p≤0.05). In
transfected MCF7 cells, p53 mRNA level increased up to
23%, 38%, 61%, and 70% in shRNA 2, 3, 4 and pooled
conditions, respectively, compared to the control (Figure 4,
a1). The MDA-MB-468 cells showed 30%, 38%, and 41%
increase in p53 mRNA level after shRNA 3, 4, and pooled
transfection conditions, respectively, in comparison to
control [Figure 4 (b1)]. ShRNA1 in both cell lines and
shRNA 2 in MDA-MB-468 cells showed no significant
effect on p53 transcripts level. These results indicate that

WEE1 silencing could induce p53 accumulation, which
could exert the pro-death function and eliminate cancer
cells with serious DNA damage.
MDM2 mRNA level (the major cellular antagonist of
p53) was determined using real time PCR in both cell lines
48 hours post-transfection. Transfected MCF7 cells with
shRNA 2, 3, 4 and pooled of shRNAs showed 10%, 40%,
22% and 42% down regulation in MDM2 gene expression
level, respectively, in comparison to the control [Figure
4 (a2)]. On the other hand, MDA-MB-468 cells did not
show any significant change in MDM2 mRNA level posttransfection
(Figure 4, b2).

Tumour Suppressive Effects of WEE1 Silencing on Breast Cancer Cells

Bcl-2 is unique amongst pro-oncogenes. Increased
expression of Bcl-2 as an anti-apoptotic protein has been
reported in many tumors (Kelly and Strasser,2011). In the
current study, Bcl-2 decreased at both mRNA (Figure4)
and protein (Figure 5) levels in breast cancer cell lines
48 h following transfection with specific WEE1 shRNAs
(p≤ 0.05). The gene expression level of Bcl-2 was downregulated
18%, 30%, 22%, and 60% in transfected MCF7
cells using shRNA 2, 3, 4, and pooled, respectively, in
comparison with control shRNA (Figure 4, a3). MDAMB-468
cells showed 25%, 26%, and 32% reduction in
Bcl-2 mRNA level after 48 h transfection with shRNA 3,
4, and pooled, respectively compared to control (Figure 4,
b3). shRNA 2 in MDA-MB-468 cells and shRNA1 in the
both cell lines, caused no significant change in the Bcl-2
transcript level.

Down-regulation of the angiogenesis marker, VEGF, upon
WEE1 silencing
VEGF is the most important angiogenesis marker and
known to be a powerful growth factor playing a central role
in promoting tumor angiogenesis via activation of VEGFR
(Hirakawa et al., 2005). When examined whether WEE1
inhibition could affect VEGF expression, a significant
decrease in the expression of VEGF at both mRNA (Figure
4) and protein (Figure 5) levels was observed after 48 h
transfection with specific shRNAs (p≤0.05). The VEGF
transcript levels were reduced 10%, 50%, 30%, and 70%
in shRNA 2, 3, 4, and pooled conditions, respectively, in
transfected MCF7 cell line (Figure 4, a4). It was downregulated
by 26%, 25%, 40%, and 38%, respectively, in
transfected MDA-MB-468 cells compared to the control
(Figure 4, b4). shRNA1 in both cell lines, caused no
significant change in the VEGF transcript level.

Discussion

In the present study; we investigated the effects
of WEE1 silencing on breast cancer cell lines. In this
regard, its effect on breast cancer cell’s viability was first
determined by MTT assay. The results showed WEE1
inhibition could significantly decrease the viability of
the breast cancer cells. The observed viability reduction
was more than 50 % upon WEE1 silencing using pooled
shRNAs, 60 and 90 h post-transfection in MCF7 and
MDA-MB-468, respectively, compared to the control
shRNA (Figure 2). To investigate functional impact of
WEE1 silencing on the cell cycle, we performed cell cycle
DNA analysis following WEE1 silencing. As shown in

Figure 3, WEE1 inhibition led to the abrogation of G2
arrest, and significant increase in cells with sub-G1 DNA
content (which could be the indicative of apoptosis).
Our results are consistent with previous studies which
reported the sensitivity to WEE1 inhibition in different
breast cancer cell lines (Iorns et al., 2009; Murrow,
Garimella et al., 2010). Although they have shown pushing
breast cancer cells through G2 arrest, which results from
inhibition or loss of WEE1, may allow DNA damage to
accumulate and induce programmed cell death in breast
cancer cells, but they have not clarified the basis for this
toxicity in different cell lines. To do more investigation,
we also examined the effect of WEE1 inhibition on the
expression of apoptotic (p53) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2)
and also growth marker (VEGF), in the two different
breast cancer cells, MCF7, which carries the wild-type
p53 and MDA-MB-468 which contains a mutant type.
The results of real-time PCR and western blotting analysis
showed that the expression of p53 significantly increased
at both mRNA (Figure 4a1, b1) and protein (Figure 5)
levels. In a recent study done by Mir et al (2010), WEE1
inhibition in irradiated glioblastoma cells could abrogate
G2-arrest and induce mitotic catastrophe and cell death.
Mitotic catastrophe constitutes a special case of apoptosis
and occurs in a p53-independent manner (Castedo et
al., 2004). In our study, WEE1 inhibition induced G2
arrest abrogation and caused a significant increase in the
fraction of sub-G1 cells (Figure 3, A and B). However,
based on these results, the induced cell death in the
breast cancer cells might be as a result of pushing breast
cancer cells toward premature mitosis and induction
of mitotic catastrophe, but the observed significant
increase in p53 level following WEE1 inhibition in
breast cancer cells should be also noted. The maximum
level of this increase was 70% and 41% in MCF7 and
MDA-MB-468, respectively. p53 has a crucial role in
the maintenance of genomic integrity and in the response
to cellular DNA damage accumulation, can stimulate
apoptosis (Amundson et al., 1998). MDA-MB-468 cells,
which carry a mutant type of p53, can undergo a change
to the pseudo-normal wild-type species under certain
circumstances (Prasad and Church,1997; Mandal et al.,
2007). Therefore, MDA-MB-468 cell line was used to
study the status of p53 following WEE1 gene silencing.
In normal conditions, p53 is expressed at an extremely
low level (Vousden and Lu,2002). Accumulation of
DNA damage is a p53-activating signal which leads to
a marked increase of active p53 protein to exert its prodeath
function. This activation occurs mainly through
post-translational mechanisms that cause an increase in the
protein half-life of p53 (Lacroix et al., 2006). Time course
experiments which done by Murrow et al (2010) suggested
that WEE1 inhibition causes DNA damage followed by
caspase activation. The observed increase in the amount
of p53 in this study following WEE1 silencing could be
explained through this effect of WEE1 inhibition on DNA
damage induction. On the other hand, pro-death activity
of p53 could be inhibited by increase transcription from
MDM2 promoter; MDM2 protein can bind to p53 and
inactivates it through enhancing the association of p53
with the proteasome (Lai et al., 2001). In the current study,

as shown in Figure 4 (a2 and b2), MDM2 mRNA levels
decreased up to 40% in transfected MCF7 cells while no
significant changes were observed in transfected MDAMB-468
cells in comparison with the control.
Interactions between pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins
are critical for susceptibility to apoptosis. The antiapoptotic
protein, Bcl-2, has been shown to effectively
confer resistance to programmed cell death. High
expression of Bcl-2 prevents cells from apoptosis caused
by cellular stress and contributed to the DNA damage
accumulation (Jiang and Milner, 2003). There are
established evidences that activated p53 function has the
capacity to repress the expression ratio of Bcl-2 (antiapoptotic
protein) and also to up-regulate the pro-apoptotic
marker, Bax, in favor of apoptosis (Porebska et al., 2006).
Our results indicated that Bcl-2 is down-regulated up
to 60% and 32% in MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cells,
respectively, upon WEE1 silencing [Figure 4 (a3 and
b3)]. These outcomes also can suggest that loss of WEE1
function might stimulate the pro-death activity of p53.
In the present study, we also assessed the effect of
WEE1 inhibition on VEGF expression. Interestingly,
real-time PCR (Figure 4) and western blotting analysis
(Figure 5) showed a significant decrease in VEGF
expression in both breast censer cells. The maximum
level of this reduction was 70% and 38% in MCF7 and
MDA-MB-468 cells, respectively [Figure 4 (a4 and b4)].
VEGF is a survival factor for tumor cells and plays a major
role in the progression of different cancers, including
breast cancer, by modulating tumor proliferation through
its promotion of tumor angiogenesis. Different studies
suggested a significant correlation between VEGF and p53
expression, they described a regulatory role for the tumor
suppressor gene p53 in angiogenesis by down-regulating
VEGF mRNA level, as well as VEGF promoter activity
(Mukhopadhyay et al., 1995; Fujisawa et al., 2003). It has
been reported that p53 has a central inhibitory role on the
transcriptional regulation of VEGF. They suggested that
p53 makes a complex with the transcription factor sp1 and
thereby inhibits the transcriptional activation of VEGF
promoter in mammary carcinoma (Pal et al., 2001). Based
on these available data, the observed decrease in the VEGF
transcript level may be as a result of the increased p53
protein expression following WEE1 inhibition. Notably,
it has been reported that the absence of growth factors
could be a major signal to trigger p53-dependent apoptosis
following p53 activation and accumulation (Canman et
al., 1995; Gottlieb and Oren,1998). However, additional
studies will be necessary to clarify the exact signaling
pathway.
Although in this study, the tumor suppressive effects
of WEE1 inhibition was observed in both breast cancer
cell line, but MDA-MB-468 cells showed a considerable
delay in cell viability reduction after WEE1 inhibition
and the levels of observed decrease in the Bcl-2 and
VEGF expression after WEE1 inhibition was also lower
in compare to MCF7.
It is important to note that p53 is haploinsufficient for
tumor suppression. It is suggested that mere reduction
in p53 dosage is sufficient to promote cancer formation
(Gottlieb et al., 1997). In an interesting research,

Vankatachalam et al. (2001) studied the p53 function for
various parameter of growth control and stress response
such as induction of G1 arrest or apoptosis, in p53+/+,
p53+/-, p53-/- cells. They showed that although in p53-/-
cells, growth control and stress response was completely
eliminated, p53+/- cells showed the reduced parameters
compared to their p53+/+ counterparts. They hypothesized
that the reduced p53 dosage in p53+/- cells, provided a
reduction in their ability to response to DNA damage
(Venkatachalam et al., 2001). It could be suggested that,
the lower p53 dosage might be expected to result in less
efficient biological effects in MDA-MB-468 following
WEE1 inhibition.
In the present study, we documented the inhibitory
effects of WEE1 gene knockdown onto breast cancer
cell lines using shRNAs against WEE1. Our results are
in concordance with the previous studies which showed
WEE1 inhibition could decrease breast cancer cell’s
viability; induce G2 arrest abrogation and an increase
in apoptotic cells (sub-G1) following WEE1 silencing.
Moreover, in this study, the observed interactions between
the pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and decrease in the
angiogenesis marker expression confirm the susceptibility
to cell death and validate the tumor suppressive effect
of WEE1 inhibition in breast cancer cells. Although,
the levels of the sensitivity to WEE1 silencing in breast
cancer cells, MCF7 and MDA-MB-468, seem to be in
concordance with the level of p53 expression.
