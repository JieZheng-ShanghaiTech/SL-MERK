Introduction

Genotoxic stress in proliferating cells activates a signaling network
referred to as the DNA damage response (DDR) that
serves to ensure genetic stability by activating cell cycle checkpoints
and initiating DNA repair.1
 Central to the response are
the phosphoinositide 3-kinase related kinases (PIKKs) ataxiatelangiectasia
mutated (ATM), ATM and Rad 3-related kinase
(ATR), and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK)2-5
which function as sensors and/or proximal transducers of
the pathway. ATR primarily responds to replication blockage
whereas ATM and DNA-PK are involved in recognition and
repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). However, there
is significant overlap between the pathways. For example,
DNA-PK is involved with repair of DNA damage resulting
from replication blockage by aphidicolin6
 and ATM is activated
by nucleoside analogues at concentrations insufficient for
DSBs.7
 Cross-talk between the PIKKs is evidenced by ATMChk1

Replicative block from UV, hydroxyurea, or nucleoside analogue
treatment activates the ATR-Chk1 pathway. Unwinding
of DNA ahead of stalled forks generates single-stranded DNA.
Binding of replication protein A (RPA) to single stranded DNA
recruits ATR via the ATR-interacting protein (ATRIP)10 and the
replication factor C (RFC)1-5-Rad17 clamp-loader which loads
the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-like Rad9-Hus1-
Rad1 (9-1-1) sliding clamp onto DNA.11,12 Rad9 binds the adaptor
topoisomerase (DNA) II binding protein 1 (TopBP1)13 which
stimulates ATR, resulting in phosphorylation of histone H2A
variant H2AX at Ser139 of its carboxy terminus to form γH2AX,14
a marker of DNA damage. γH2AX may be important for recruitment
of repair proteins and checkpoint maintenance in response
to DSBs15 and may also be integral for genomic stability following
replicative stress.16 ATR activates Chk1 by phosphorylating

Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) regulates cell cycle checkpoints and DNA damage repair in response to genotoxic stress.
Inhibition of Chk1 is an emerging strategy for potentiating the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs. Here, we
demonstrate that AZD7762, an ATP-competitive Chk1/2 inhibitor induces γH2AX in gemcitabine-treated cells by altering
both dynamics and stability of replication forks, allowing the firing of suppressed replication origins as measured by DNA
fiber combing and causing a dramatic increase in DNA breaks as measured by comet assay. Furthermore, we identify
ATM and DNA-PK, rather than ATR, as the kinases mediating γH2AX induction, suggesting AZD7762 converts stalled
forks into double strand breaks (DSBs). Consistent with DSB formation upon fork collapse, cells deficient in DSB repair by
lack of BRCA2, XRCC3 or DNA-PK were selectively more sensitive to combined AZD7762 and gemcitabine. Checkpoint
abrogation by AZD7762 also caused premature mitosis in gemcitabine-treated cells arrested in G1
/early S-phase.
Prevention of premature mitotic entry via Cdk1 siRNA knockdown suppressed apoptosis. These results demonstrate
that chemosensitization of gemcitabine by Chk1 inhibition results from at least three cellular events, namely, activation
of origin firing, destabilization of stalled replication forks and entry of cells with damaged DNA into lethal mitosis.
Additionally, the current study indicates that the combination of Chk1 inhibitor and gemcitabine may be particularly
effective in targeting tumors with specific DNA repair defects.
996 Cell Cycle Volume 9 Issue 5

In addition to its effect on checkpoints, Chk1 inhibition with
7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01) or XL844 following gemcitabine
treatment induces γH2AX.32,33 The kinase mediating the
increase in γH2AX and how it relates to the effect of Chk1 inhibition
on stalled replication forks have not been elucidated.
The current study demonstrates that AZD7762, an ATPcompetitive
Chk1/2 inhibitor undergoing phase I trials, markedly
induces γH2AX, abrogates cell cycle arrest, and initiates
apoptosis in gemcitabine-treated cells. AZD7762 alters replication
fork dynamics by allowing initiation of replicons suppressed
by gemcitabine. Unexpectedly, we found γH2AX formation was
mediated by ATM and DNA-PK, rather than ATR, suggesting
AZD7762 converted forks stalled by gemcitabine into DSBs.
Consistent with DSB formation, cells deficient in DSB repair by
lack of BRCA2, Rad51 paralog XRCC3, or DNA-PK were more
sensitive to combined AZD7762 and gemcitabine. These novel
findings suggest the combination of AZD7762 and gemcitabine
may be particularly effective in targeting tumors with specific
DDR defects.

Results

The impact of Chk1 inhibition on gemcitabine sensitivity was
examined via cell proliferation assay. AZD7762 alone did not
affect cell proliferation (Fig. 1A) but potentiated the anti-proliferative
effect of gemcitabine. The percentage of apoptotic

17 Chk1 contributes to DDR by effecting
S-phase and G2
/M phase arrest through its interaction with
Cdc25 phosphatases.18 Additionally, Chk1 coordinates Rad51-
mediated homologous recombination (HR) involved with DSB
break repair19 and is important for the maintenance of viable replication
structures after DNA polymerase stalling.20
Because of its critical role in cellular response to genotoxic
stress, disruption of Chk1 function using small molecules is a
strategy for improving the efficacy of DNA-targeted chemotherapeutics.
Chk1 inhibition potentiates the cytotoxicity of
genotoxic agents in vitro and in vivo.21-27 Several Chk1 inhibitors
are undergoing clinical evaluation in combination with
topoisomerase I poison or the deoxycytidine analogue gemcitabine
(2', 2'-difluoro-2'-deoxycytidine).28 Gemcitabine is phosphorylated
intracellularly and its diphosphate form (dFdCDP)
depletes cellular pools of dNTPs via inhibition of ribonucleotide
reductase,29 while incorporation of gemcitabine triphosphate
(dFdCTP) into DNA causes polymerase stalling one
base beyond the site of addition.30 These perturbations of DNA
metabolism prevent complete replication and activate the DNA
damage response pathway.31 In cells treated with gemcitabine,
Chk1 inhibition abolishes S-phase checkpoint27,32 and causes
premature mitosis.26,27,33,34 However, a previous study indicated
a lack of correlation between premature mitotic entry and cytotoxicity35
bringing into question the mechanism for chemosensitization
by Chk1 inhibitors.

cells treated with gemcitabine and AZD7762 was likely due to
reduced total Chk1 protein.
We then examined the impact of AZD7762 on DDR. In cells
treated only with gemcitabine we observed minimal induction of
γH2AX (Fig. 2A). Incubation with AZD7762 after gemcitabine
caused a marked increase in γH2AX. Total levels of H2AX were
unchanged. γH2AX formation was not diminished by Z-VADFMK,
indicating the increase in γH2AX was not related to apoptotic
DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2A, lower). To confirm increased
γH2AX was due to Chk1 inhibition, Chk1 siRNA-transfected
cells were treated with gemcitabine. Chk1 siRNA recapitulated
AZD7762 effects (Fig. 2B), resulting in γH2AX induction in
cells treated with gemcitabine alone comparable to that in cells

cells after treatment was assessed with quantitative fluorescence
microscopy of DAPI-stained cells (Fig. 1B). Treatment with
AZD7762 after gemcitabine increased the percentage of apoptotic
cells from 6% to 26%. When gemcitabine-treated cultures
were treated with or without AZD7762 and then cultured an
additional 24 h in drug-free media, AZD7762 increased the
percentage of apoptotic cells from 17% to 45%. Pan-caspase
inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK reduced the number of apoptotic nuclei,
consistent with their development being a caspase-dependent
process. In gemcitabine-treated cells, AZD7762 increased levels
of 89 kDa PARP cleavage product, a marker of apoptosis
(Fig. 1C). We confirmed gemcitabine induced Ser317 and Ser345
Chk1 phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). Decreased phospho-Chk1 in

3% to 9%. Replication fork velocity was also determined.
Gemcitabine caused a 65% reduction in fork velocity (Suppl.
Fig. 1C). AZD7762 demonstrated only a very modest, albeit
statistically significant, restoration of the median fork velocity
in gemcitabine-treated cultures. Additionally, AZD7762 did not
cause an increase in DNA replication in gemcitabine-treated cells
in assays utilizing tritiated thymidine incorporation to measure
DNA synthesis (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest
that forks emanating from disinhibited origins stalled after
limited replication.
ATR is the PIKK primarily involved with DDR to replicative
stress and phosphorylates H2AX at Ser139.
14 The contribution of
ATR to increased γH2AX was assessed in ATRFlox cells which
have one functional ATR allele flanked by LoxP sites that is susceptible
to Cre recombinase-mediated deletion.38 ATR expression
in ATRFlox cells is lower than in the HCT116 cells from
which they were derived, likely due to LoxP sites hindering gene
expression (Fig. 3A). Treatment with Cre recombinase further
suppressed ATR. However, ATR suppression did not diminish
induction of γH2AX in cells treated with gemcitabine and
AZD7762. Rather, ATR loss resulted in increased γH2AX in cells
treated with gemcitabine alone. Similar results were observed in
ATR hypomorphic lymphoblasts isolated from a Seckel syndrome
patient when compared to normal lymphoblasts (Fig. 3B). These
data suggest ATR functions through Chk1 to prevent increased
DNA damage leading to γH2AX induction following replicative
stress but is not the PIKK responsible for γH2AX induction in
cells treated with gemcitabine and AZD7762.
We considered whether Chk1 inhibition after gemcitabine
converted stalled forks into DSBs that might impinge upon
ATM, the PIKK mediating the response to DSBs in S-phase
cells. ATM is recruited and activated by the Mre11-Rad50-NBS1
(MRN) complex39 which promotes autophosphorylation of
Ser1981 of ATM, allowing dissolution of ATM dimers into active
monomers.40 This results in phosphorylation of targets involved
in DDR, including H2AX. In HCT116 cells, AZD7762 combined
with gemcitabine induced Ser1981 phosphorylation of ATM
(Fig. 3A). To test whether activated ATM mediated induction of
γH2AX we compared lymphoblasts from a normal individual to
those from an individual with ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) deficient
for ATM. Induction of γH2AX appeared intact in AT cells (Fig.
3B), indicating ATM is dispensable for γH2AX in these cells and
strongly implicating DNA-PK involvement. DNA-PK is composed
of the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer and the catalytic subunit,
DNA-PKcs.5,41 DNA-PK mediates non-homologous end joining
(NHEJ) of DSBs and its activation involves autophosphorylation
at Ser2056 and Thr2609.
42,43 In HCT116 cells, gemcitabine followed
by AZD7762 induced Ser2056 phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs
(Fig. 4A) and immunofluorescence analysis indicated γH2AX
colocalized with phospho-Ser2056 DNA-PKcs (Suppl. Fig. 2).
DNA-PK inhibitor NU7026 diminished γH2AX induction
in AT cells treated with both gemcitabine and AZD7762 (Fig.
4B). We examined the effect of siRNA-mediated suppression
of DNA-PKcs in HCT116 cells. DNA-PKcs siRNA diminished
γH2AX induction (Fig. 4C), confirming DNA-PK was the primary
mediator of increased DDR to Chk1 inhibition following

expressing Chk1 and treated with gemcitabine and AZD7762.
Although AZD7762 also inhibits Chk2,26 Chk2 siRNA did not
phenocopy AZD7762 (Fig. 2B, lower), indicating the effects of
AZD7762 were primarily due to Chk1 inhibition, consistent
with another study demonstrating that Chk2 deficiency does not
affect gemcitabine cytotoxicity.36
To examine possible causes of increased DDR related to Chk1
inhibition, we used DNA fiber combing analysis to determine
the impact of AZD7762 on suppression of replication origin firing
after gemcitabine. Cultures were sequentially pulse-labeled
with IdU and CldU during drug treatment (Fig. 2C). DNA
fibers incorporating IdU and CldU were visualized as green and
red tracks, respectively, under immunofluorescence after labeling
with halogenated nucleoside-specific antibodies. Newly synthesized
DNA emanating from replication origins fired prior to
the initial IdU pulse was labeled green (Fig. 2C, a). Contiguous
with green tracts were red tracts of DNA synthesized as replication
continued during the CldU pulse. Conversely, nascent DNA
emanating from replication origins fired during the CldU pulse
after gemcitabine was labeled only red (Fig. 2C, b). The percentage
of new origins firing after the first pulse during various drug
treatments was calculated by dividing the number of red-only
tracts by the total red/green and red-only tracts. Treatment with
AZD7762 increased the percentage of new origins from 33% to
42% (Fig. 2D), consistent with a study indicating Chk1 regulates
replication initiation in unperturbed S-phase.37 Gemcitabine
suppressed the percentage of new origins to 3%. AZD7762
partially restored origin firing suppressed by gemcitabine from

< 0.05) more sensitive to the combination than their wildtype
counterpart at gemcitabine concentrations above 0.01 µM (Fig.
5D). These data are consistent with Chk1 inhibition following
replicative stress converting stalled forks to DSBs that require
both HR and NHEJ repair pathways for survival.
To examine the interplay between checkpoint abrogation and
enhanced DDR due to Chk1 inhibition, the effects of AZD7762
on cell cycle progression were studied in gemcitabine-treated
cells. Treatment with AZD7762 had no appreciable effect on
cell cycle distribution (Fig. 6A) as determined by flow cytometry
for DNA content and staining for mitotic marker MPM2.
To monitor progression of S-phase cells through the cell cycle,
asynchronous cultures were pulse-labeled with bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdU) and the fate of BrdU-positive cells was observed
after drug treatment. Untreated or AZD7762-treated cells traversed
S-phase and cycled normally, eventually accumulating
in G1
 (Suppl. Fig. 3). Treatment with gemcitabine caused accumulation
of cells with G1
/early S-phase DNA content and concomitant
reduction in the percentage of mitotic cells from 3.2%
to 0.06% (Fig. 6A). Gemcitabine also caused the loss of mitotic
marker phospho-Ser10-histone H3, as determined by western
blot (Fig. 2B, upper). Gemcitabine prevented cells incorporating
BrdU from completing S-phase (Suppl. Fig. 3). As expected,
inhibition of Chk1 by AZD7762 after gemcitabine abrogated
G1
/early S-phase arrest, restoring phospho-Ser10-histone H3 (Fig.
2B, upper). Chk1 siRNA also restored phospho-Ser10-histone
H3 in gemcitabine-treated cells, similar to AZD7762 (Fig. 2B,
upper), while Chk2 siRNA failed to do so (Fig. 2B, lower). In
gemcitabine-treated cultures, AZD7762 increased the percentage
of MPM2 positive cells from 0.12% to 12% (Fig. 6A). Notably,
the majority of these mitotic cells had G1

replicative stress in HCT116 cells. However, in MKN-74 cells,
both siRNA-mediated knockdown of DNA-PKcs and inhibition
of ATM with KU55933 were required for diminution of γH2AX,
indicating both PIKKs contribute to γH2AX induction in these
cells (Fig. 4D).
Our data supported the idea that Chk1 inhibition following
gemcitabine converted stalled forks into DSBs. To assess the
impact of AZD7762 on the extent of DNA damage in gemcitabine-treated
cells, we used the comet assay. Cells were treated
with vehicle or gemcitabine for 45 min, washed, and incubated an
additional 16 h. In cultures also treated with AZD7762, the drug
was added 45 min prior to gemcitabine treatment and maintained
throughout the experiment. Cells exposed to IR and SN-38, the
active metabolite of irinotecan, were included as positive controls
for DSBs. Z-VAD-FMK was included during treatment to
prevent apoptotic DNA fragmentation from contributing to the
amount of DNA damage determined by the assay. AZD7762
increased the amount of DNA damage in gemcitabine-treated
cells, doubling the median TM from 17 to 33 (Fig. 5A), a level
comparable to that caused by IR and SN-38.
We hypothesized that cells defective in DSB repair by virtue
of deficiency in either HR or NHEJ would be more sensitive to
the combination of gemcitabine and Chk1 inhibitor. In a colony
formation assay, the BRCA2-deficient VC8 cell line was more
susceptible to treatment with gemcitabine and AZD7762 than
its isogenic counterpart complemented with a bacterial artificial
chromosome expressing BRCA2 (Fig. 5B). Similarly, lack of
Rad51 paralog XRCC3 in irs1SF cells rendered them more sensitive
than parental AA8 cells to the combination of drugs (Fig.
5C). Mefs from severe combined immune deficiency (SCID)
mice defective for DNA-PKcs were slightly but significantly (p

mitotic entry. We also confirmed these results with flow cytometry
analysis of MPM2 and DNA content (data not shown).

premature mitosis was important for cell death. Flow
analysis demonstrated gemcitabine induced accumulation of G1

rescued cells from apoptosis by negating the S-phase targeting
effect of gemcitabine.

Discussion

Dysregulation of cell cycle checkpoints is integral for neoplastic
transformation of cancer cells and results in a reduced capacity to
regulate cell cycle progression after exposure to genotoxic agents.
One strategy for potentiation of conventional DNA-targeted therapies
exploits the loss of checkpoints in cancer cells through the
pharmacologic inhibition of remaining cell cycle controls. Small
molecule inhibitors of Chk1 represent a promising class of drugs
shown to improve the efficacy of genotoxic agents both in vitro
and in vivo. The current study demonstrates that Chk1/2 inhibitor
AZD7762 increases the sensitivity of cells to gemcitabine by
abrogating suppression of replication origin firing, destabilizing
stalled replication forks, and inducing mitotic death.

content, indicating that AZD7762 induced premature mitosis.
Consistent with premature mitosis, cells labeled with BrdU prior
to gemcitabine treatment failed to complete DNA replication
when treated with AZD7762 (Suppl. Fig. 3). Interestingly, very
few mid/late S-phase cells prematurely entered into mitosis when
treated with AZD7762 subsequent to gemcitabine. To examine
the fate of cells entering aberrant mitosis, HCT116 cells expressing
GFP-linked histone H2B were used with time-lapse microscopy.
In cultures treated with AZD7762 after gemcitabine, we
began observing the appearance of cells with condensed DNA
entering mitosis after about 18 h (Suppl. data). These cells
futilely attempted cytokinesis while the DNA became highly
fragmented, suggesting that premature mitosis resulted in cell
death. This aberrant mitosis was not observed with the other
treatments (data not shown).
To test whether increased apoptosis resulting from Chk1
inhibition was due to premature mitosis, we used Cdk1 siRNA
to prevent mitotic entry in cells treated with gemcitabine and
AZD7762. Cells were transfected with control or Cdk1 siRNA
for 12 h and treated with gemcitabine for 2 h followed by 24 h
treatment with AZD7762. Cdk1 expression was diminished at
12 h and maximally suppressed by 24 h (Fig. 6B). Cdk1 siRNA
prevented AZD7762 from restoring phospho-Ser10-histone H3
in gemcitabine-treated cells (Fig. 6C), indicating prevention of

enzyme and it is unclear if the experiments in the current study
would allow sufficient time for this to occur.
Chk1 inhibition following gemcitabine resulted in markedly
increased γH2AX. γH2AX induction by UV- or 5-fluorouracil-induced
replicative stress is mediated by ATR.9,14 However,
induction of γH2AX by gemcitabine and AZD7762 was not
diminished in cells with reduced expression of ATR, indicating
ATR was not the major H2AX kinase and that ATR-mediated
Chk1 activation protected against development of lesions
impinging upon other PIKKs. Indeed, AZD7762 caused activating
phosphorylation of ATM and DNA-PKcs. ATM phosphorylation
was ATR-independent (Fig. 3), in contrast to that induced
by UV.9
 In response to IR, ATM and DNA-PK function redundantly
in phosphorylating H2AX.47 Intact γH2AX formation in
ATM-deficient lymphoblasts in response to gemcitabine followed
by AZD7762 suggested γH2AX formation was mediated by
DNA-PK. In HCT116 cells, siRNA knockdown of DNA-PKcs
diminished γH2AX formation, while neither ATM knockdown
nor chemical inhibition had an impact, suggesting DNA-PK
was the mediator of γH2AX formation in these cells. However,

Chk1 blocks the activation of late replicons in cells exposed to
replicative stress.44 Using DNA fiber combing, we observed that
AZD7762 partially restores firing of previously suppressed replication
origins in gemcitabine-treated cells. However, in gemcitabine-treated
cells, AZD7762 did not increase DNA synthesis or
fork velocity. These data suggest that newly fired replicons likely
stalled after limited replication. The incorporation of gemcitabine
into DNA causes polymerase stalling one base beyond the site
of addition30 resulting in masked chain termination that makes
its excision difficult for DNA repair systems.45 Consequently,
the inability to remove gemcitabine from DNA may present an
impasse for the completion of DNA synthesis, even when Chk1-
induced cell cycle controls have been inhibited. In contrast to such
passive replication inhibition caused by a physical lesion, active
replication inhibition by the checkpoint may be abrogated with
Chk1 inhibition as illustrated by the restoration of DNA synthesis
by either UCN-01 or CHIR-124 after exposure to the topoisomerase
I poison camptothecin.46 Additionally, ribonucleotide
reductase inhibition by gemcitabine is irreversible. Consequently,
replenishment of dNTP pools would require synthesis of new

cycle arrest by Chk1 inhibition allows S-phase cells to progress
directly into mitosis with incompletely replicated DNA, resulting
in apoptosis. The current study contributes to the growing
evidence that Chk1 inhibition is a viable strategy for potentiation
of DNA-targeted therapies, meriting further inquiry.

Clonogenicity and proliferation assays. Colony assays were
performed as described.23 For proliferation assays, cells were
seeded in 96-well plates and allowed 24 h to attach. After treatment,
cells were cultured 48 h in drug-free media and assayed with
WST-8 (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg,
MD) as per manufacturer’s directions. Absorbance at 450 nm
was measured on a Spectramax 340pc (Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale, CA).
Immunoblotting. Immunoblotting was performed as
described.23 Mouse monoclonal antibodies were: ATM (2C1),

inhibition of γH2AX induction in MKN-74 cells required inhibition
of ATM in addition to DNA-PKcs knockdown, indicating
redundancy within these kinases. Thus, the relative contribution
of ATM and DNA-PK to γH2AX formation appears to be cell
line dependent. A possible explanation is that Mre11 is mutated
in HCT116 cells, resulting in lowered expression of the MRN
complex.48 While MRN deficiency does not prevent ATM activation,
it does result in defective Chk2 phosphorylation48 and likely
diminishes ATM’s contribution to γH2AX formation. These findings
are consistent with a study demonstrating ATR-deficiency in
Mefs causes increased γH2AX following exposure to aphidicolin
mediated by DNA-PK and ATM.16
Activation of ATM and DNA-PK suggested AZD7762 converted
stalled forks into DSBs, consistent with studies in yeast
showing checkpoint deficiency leads to abnormal DNA structures
after replicative stress likely due to collapse of stalled forks.49 We
examined whether deficiencies in pathways responsive to DSBs
impacted survival of cells exposed to gemcitabine and AZD7762.
AZD7762 potentiated the effects of gemcitabine in VC8 cells
deficient for BRCA2 and irs1-SF cells deficient for Rad51 paralog
XRCC3 suggesting HR deficiencies prevented repair of breaks
induced by the combination of drugs. Although Chk1 is required
for HR, we speculate the lack of epistasis between Chk1 inhibition
and HR deficiency is due to recovery of Chk1-mediated functions
after AZD7762 wash in the clonogenicity assay. Because
Chk1 inhibition likely diminishes repair through HR, activation
of DNA-PK may reflect a response of NHEJ to DSBs when
HR is compromised. DNA-PKcs-deficient SCID Mefs exhibited
reduced clonogenic survival when treated with AZD7762 after
gemcitabine. However, the degree of sensitization by AZD7762
was smaller in SCID Mefs compared to HR-deficient cell lines,
consistent with HR being the dominant DSB repair pathway
in S-phase cells. These data provide evidence that DNA repair
deficiencies compromise cancer cell survival after treatment with
combined gemcitabine and AZD7762, providing an opportunity
to target tumors with specific DDR defects.
Gemcitabine-treated cells incubated with AZD7762 progressed
from G1
/early S-phase directly into mitosis without
completing DNA replication. Cdk1 suppression with siRNA
prevented this aberrant mitotic entry, resulting in decreased
apoptosis. These data argue Cdk1 activity and/or premature
mitosis in cells with incompletely replicated DNA is important
for increased apoptosis through Chk1 inhibition. It is worth
noting that few mid/late S-phase cells underwent premature
mitosis. One explantation is that an ATR/Chk1-independent
S-phase checkpoint is activated in mid/late S-phase cells that is
not active in G1
/early S-phase cells. It is possible that increased
DSBs resulting from fork collapse caused by AZD7762 in
gemcitabine-treated mid/late S-phase cells activate the ATMdependent
intra-S phase checkpoint that would not be susceptible
to Chk1 inhibition.
We propose the following model for Chk1 inhibitor chemosensitization
after replicative stress (Fig. 6D). Chk1 inhibition
allows firing of suppressed replication origins after replicative
stress and destabilizes stalled forks, thereby preventing completion
of replication and generating DSBs. Finally, abrogation of cell
