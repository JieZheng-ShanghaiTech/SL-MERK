SUMMARY
Mutations affecting RNA splicing factors are the most common genetic
alterations in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients and occur in a mutually
exclusive manner. The basis for the mutual exclusivity of these mutations and
how they contribute to MDS is not well understood. Here we report that although
different spliceosome gene mutations impart distinct effects on splicing, they
are negatively selected for when co-expressed due to aberrant splicing and
downregulation of regulators of hematopoietic stem cell survival and quiescence.
In addition to this synthetic lethal interaction, mutations in the splicing
factors SF3B1 and SRSF2 share convergent effects on aberrant splicing of mRNAs
that promote nuclear factor κB signaling. These data identify shared
consequences of splicing-factor mutations and the basis for their mutual
exclusivity.Graphical AbstractIn Brief
Lee et al. report that
SF3B1
and
SRSF2
mutations elicit distinct effects on splicing and are synthetically lethal due
to the cumulative impact on hematopoietic stem cell survival and quiescence.
These mutations share convergent effects on promoting NF-κB signaling to
drive myelodysplastic syndrome.INTRODUCTION
Recurrent mutations in genes encoding spliceosome components have been
identified across multiple cancer types. Spliceosomal gene mutations most commonly
occur in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML),
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (
Papaemmanuil et al.,
2011
;
Yoshida et al., 2011
),
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (
Wang et al.,
2011
), and uveal melanoma (
Harbour et
al., 2013
;
Martin et al., 2013
).
SF3B1, U2AF1
, and
SRSF2
are the most commonly
mutated genes. Mutations in each of these occur as heterozygous point mutations at
specific residues, suggesting gain-of-function alterations. In addition, mutations
in spliceosome genes are mutually exclusive with one another, presumably due to
redundant effects and/or a limit on cellular tolerance of disrupted spliceosome
function.
Despite insights into the effects of each mutation on pre-mRNA splicing, the
basis for their mutual exclusivity, and functionally convergent effects they may
have are unknown. For example, recent work identified that mutations affecting the
core splicing factor SF3B1 are associated with cryptic 3′ splice site
selection and altered branchpoint recognition (
Darman
et al., 2015
;
DeBoever et al.,
2015
). In contrast, mutations affecting SRSF2, an auxiliary splicing factor
that binds exonic splicing enhancers to promote splicing, alter its RNA binding
preference in a sequence-specific manner and thereby alter the efficiency of exon
inclusion (
Kim et al., 2015
;
Zhang et al., 2015
). Finally, mutations affecting U2AF1
either promote or repress 3′ splice site based on sequences flanking the AG
dinucleotide (
Ilagan et al., 2014
). Given
that the effects of
SF3B1, U2AF1
, and
SRSF2
mutations on splicing mechanisms are distinct, it is unclear why these mutations are
mutually exclusive. Moreover, evaluation of the effects of these mutations on
splicing and gene expression in an isogenic manner has not been performed. Here we
directly assessed the functional basis for the mutual exclusivity of spliceosome
gene mutations using models expressing single- or double-mutant splicing factors
simultaneously. These data provide a functional explanation for the genetic
configuration of spliceosome gene mutations and identify a convergent effect of
these mutations on a pathway of established relevance to MDS pathogenesis.RESULTS
Simultaneous Expression of
Srsf2
and
Sf3b1
Mutations Is Incompatible with Hematopoiesis
Evaluation of sequencing data from >4,000 patients with myeloid
neoplasms revealed that while ~48% (1,935/4,032) have a mutation in an
RNA splicing factor, only ~2% of patients (86/4,032) have >1
splicing-factor mutation (
Figure 1A
and
Table S1
). To
understand the basis of this mutual exclusivity, we generated mice for inducible
heterozygous expression of two of the most common splicing-factor mutations in
MDS (
SF3B1
K700E
and
SRSF2
P95H
) simultaneously (
Figure 1B
). We performed noncompetitive bone marrow
transplantation (BMT), whereby each mutation was induced following stable
engraftment in recipient mice (
Figure 1B
).
Bone marrow (BM) cells co-expressing
Srsf2
P95H
and
Sf3b1
K700E
mutations were severely defective in
multi-lineage reconstitution compared with other groups (Figures
​
(Figures1C,
1C
,
​
,1D,
1D
, and
S1A–S1D
).
Chimerism analysis and evaluation for recombination prior to
polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (pIpC) administration confirmed minimal
spontaneous excision prior to BMT (Figures
S1E
and
S1F
). In competitive BMT
(
Figure 1E
), BM cells co-expressing
Sf3b1
K700E
and
Srsf2
P95H
mutations were more readily
outcompeted by competitor BM cells relative to single-mutant or wild-type (WT)
controls. Analyses of hematopoietic organs 6 months post BMT revealed a
near-complete absence of
Srsf2
P95H/+
Sf3b1
K700E/+
cells, which was distinct from
single-mutant groups (Figures
​
(Figures1E,
1E
,
​
,1F,
1F
, and
S1C
). These data provide
functional evidence that co-expression of mutant RNA splicing factors is not
tolerated.

Expression of Splicing-Factor Mutations in a Homozygous or Hemizygous State
Is Incompatible with Hematopoiesis
Prior studies identified that cells bearing mutant splicing factors
require the WT allele for survival (
Lee et al.,
2016
;
Zhou et al., 2015
).
While these observations potentially explain the heterozygous nature of
splicing-factor mutations in patients, the effect of expressing splicing-factor
mutation in a homozygous manner was not assessed. To test this, we generated
mice with conditional homozygous expression of the
SRSF2
P95H
mutation
(
Mx1
-Cre
+
Srsf2
P95H/P95H
). In competitive BMT assays,
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from these mice showed severe
defects in multi-lineage reconstitution relative to
Mx1
-Cre
+
Srsf2
P95H/+
or
Mx1
-Cre
+
WT HSPCs, similar to defects seen with hemizygous
Srsf2

expression
(

P95H/fl
) (Figures
​
(Figures1G,
1G
,
​
,1H,
1H
, and
S1G–S1I
). These
data firmly establish that neither hemizygous nor homozygous expression of
splicing-factor mutations is tolerated, highlighting the unique dependency of
spliceosome-mutant cells on residual WT spliceosome function.
Simultaneous Expression of

and

To identify why co-expression of

resulted in severe HSPC dysfunction,

Selection against co-expression of two mutant splicing factors was
strongly supported by the fact that mice with hematopoietic-specific expression
of
Srsf2
P95H
and
Sf3b1
K700E
(
Vav
-Cre
+
Srsf2
P95H/+

) mutations were associated with 100%
lethality at weaning, while single-mutant mice were present at the expected
frequencies (
Figure 2C
). Analysis of 139
embryos at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) revealed that
Vav
-Cre
+
Srsf2

Sf3b1

fetuses were detectable at the expected
frequency (Figures

and

). E14.5
Vav
-Cre
+
Srsf2

Sf3b1
K700E/+
fetal livers had increased number of
LSK cells as well as phenotypic long-term hematopoietic stem cell (LT-HSC, LSK
CD150
+
CD48
−
), multi-potent progenitor (MPP,
LSK CD150
−

), HPC-1 (LSK

), and HPC-2 (LSK CD150
+

+
) populations compared with all other genotypes (Figures
​
(Figures2D,
2D
,
​
,2E,
2E
, and
S2C–S2G
). Despite a significant increase in HSPCs,
Vav
-Cre
+
Srsf2
P95H/+
Sf3b1
K700E/+
fetal liver cells had significantly
impaired colony-forming ability
in vitro
(
Figure 2F
) and markedly increased percentage of
cycling and apoptotic cells (Figures
2G–2I
). These derangements in HSPC phenotypes were manifest
by E18.5 when
Vav
-Cre
+
Srsf2
P95H/+
Sf3b1
K700E/+
fetuses had near absence of
hematopoietic cells in the BM as well as increased apoptotic cells in fetal
liver (Figures
S2H
and
S2I
). Taken
together, these data demonstrate that co-expression of splicing-factor mutations
compromises hematopoiesis, driven by aberrant cell-cycle progression and
increased apoptosis of HSPCs.
Srsf2
and
Sf3b1
Mutations Have Largely
Distinct Effects on Gene Expression
To understand the mechanistic basis for mutual exclusivity of
SF3B1
and
SRSF2
mutations, we performed
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on lineage
−
c-Kit
+
(LK)
cells from
Mx1
-Cre
+
Srsf2
P95H/+
Sf3b1
K700E/+
mice as well as single-mutant and WT
controls (
Figure 3A
). The mean allelic
ratio of
Sf3b1
K700E
and
Srsf2
P95H
expressed in double-mutant cells was
20.7% and 33.5%, markedly lower than the ~50% expression in single-mutant
controls, illustrating the intolerability of combining
SF3B1
and
SRSF2
mutations (
Figure
3B
). Expression of either mutation resulted in dysregulation of
hundreds of coding genes (
Figure 3C
and
Table S2
).
Mx1
-Cre
+
Srsf2
P95H/+
Sf3b1
K700E/+
cells exhibited significantly more gene
dysregulation than single-mutant cells, consistent with their more dramatic
biological phenotype (
Figure 3D
).
Double-mutant cells shared a greater proportion of differentially expressed
genes with each single-mutant group than single mutants shared with one another
(
Figure 3E
). Gene ontology (GO)
analysis of coding genes differentially expressed within each genotype relative
to WT control revealed strong signatures of impaired hematopoiesis in
double-mutant cells, consistent with the multi-lineage defects in these cells
(
Figure 3F
and
Table S3
).

We next tested whether mutations in SF3B1 and SRSF2 have independent
effects on gene expression: that is, whether double-mutant cells recapitulated
the gene dysregulation observed for each single-mutant genotype relative to WT.
Approximately 80% and 40% of genes dysregulated in
Mx1
-Cre
+
Sf3b1
K700E/+
and
Mx1
-Cre
+
Srsf2
P95H/+
single-mutant cells were also
dysregulated in
Mx1
-Cre
Sf3b1
K700E/+
Srsf2
P95H/+
double-mutant cells (
Figure 3E
and
Table S2
). That degree of recapitulation of gene
dysregulation was highly similar to and statistically indistinguishable (p =
0.90 and 0.44 for
Sf3b1
K700E
and
Srsf2
P95H
mutations, respectively) from expected
recapitulation under the assumption of independence (
Figure S3A
). We therefore
conclude that SF3B1 and SRSF2 mutations have independent effects on gene
expression even when present in the same cell. Interestingly, in addition to
recapitulating the dysregulation of specific genes expected based on
single-mutant cells, double-mutant cells exhibited additional gene dysregulation
(Figures
S3B
and
S3C
), consistent with the
severe hematopoietic phenotype of these cells. These results suggest that SF3B1
and SRSF2 mutations have independent but compound effects on gene expression
when present in the same cell.
Srsf2
and
Sf3b1
Mutations Have Distinct and
Independent Effects on Splicing
We next assessed the consequences of single versus double mutations in
Sf3b1
and
Srsf2
on splicing (
Table S4
). Mutations in
SF3B1 have been proposed to alter 3′ splice site recognition (
Darman et al., 2015
;
DeBoever et al., 2015
). In contrast, mutations in
SRSF2 alter exon recognition via preferential recognition of C-rich exonic
splicing enhancer (ESE) motifs relative to G-rich ESEs, while WT SRSF2
recognizes both classes of ESEs (
Kim et al.,
2015
;
Zhang et al., 2015
). Our
current understanding of SF3B1 and SRSF2 mutations therefore indicates that they
induce distinct changes in splicing. However, the consequences of these
mutations on splicing have not been compared in an isogenic context.
We used our double-mutant system to directly compare the effects of
SF3B1 and SRSF2 mutations on RNA splicing. Consistent with prior studies,
Sf3b1
and
Srsf2
mutations affected
3′ splice site and exon recognition, respectively (Figures
​
(Figures4A,
4A
,
​
,4B,
4B
,
S4A
, and
S4B
). We observed a
modest enrichment of adenosines upstream of intron-proximal 3′ splice
site promoted by the
Sf3b1
K700E
mutation,
independent of the
Srsf2
P95H
mutation (
Figure S4C
). This
enrichment was absent from cells expressing
Srsf2
P95H
alone. Cassette exons promoted versus
repressed in cells expressing
Srsf2
P95H
were
respectively enriched for CCNG and GGNG ESEs, independent of the presence or
absence of
Sf3b1
K700E
, but were absent from cells
expressing
Sf3b1
K700E
alone (Figures
​
(Figures4C
4C
and
S4D
). These analyses are consistent with previous reports
that
SF3B1
and
SRSF2
mutations affect branch
point recognition and ESE preference, respectively, and further demonstrate that
these changes in splicing are specific to
SF3B1
and
SRSF2
mutations.

As
Sf3b1
and
Srsf2
mutations cause
distinct changes in splicing, even when simultaneously present, we hypothesized
that the effects of these mutations on splicing were independent. Consistent
with this hypothesis, double-mutant cells recapitulated the preferential effects
of
Sf3b1
and
Srsf2
mutations on 3′
splice site recognition and cassette exon recognition, respectively, that we
observed in single-mutant cells (
Figure S4A
). We did not observe widespread decreases in
splicing efficiency, such as retention of constitutive introns, in double mutant
cells (
Figure S4E
).
Instead,
Mx1
-Cre
+
Srsf2
P95H/+
Sf3b1
K700E/+
cells exhibited modest increases in
mis-spliced genes relative to cells bearing single mutations in
Sf3b1
or
Srsf2
(Figures
​
(Figures4A

and
​
and4B

Mx1

cells recapitulated 40% and 32% of
splicing dysregulation driven by expression of the single mutations in
Sf3b1
K700E
and
Srsf2
P95H
, respectively (
Figure S4F
). We
identified only seven genes mis-spliced in both
Mx1

distinct and independent consequences on splicing.
To confirm these findings, we performed RNA-seq on purified LK cells

frequencies of both mutations in double-mutant cells were near 50% and
comparable with those of

). GO analysis revealed
signatures of impaired hematopoiesis in double-mutant cells, consistent with
those seen in
Mx1
-Cre mice (
Figure S4G
and
Table S5
). Moreover,
effects on splicing similar to those seen in the Mx1-Cre system were seen in
HSPCs from Vav-Cre mice, including preferential effects of
Sf3b1
and
Srsf2
mutations on 3′
splice site and cassette exon recognition, respectively (Figures

Combined Expression of

Sensitivity to Inflammatory Stimulation
Given the largely non-overlapping effects of
Srsf2
P95H
and
Sf3b1
K700E
mutations on gene expression and
splicing, we evaluated transcripts that exhibited concomitant dysregulation in
gene expression and splicing in the double-mutant state (
Figure 5A
and
Table S6
). Multiple regulators of HSPC survival and
quiescence were significantly dysregulated and mis-spliced in
Srsf2

HSPCs, including the thrombopoietin
receptor c-Mpl, integrin aIIb (CD41), and the transcription factor Pbx1 (Figures

reduced expression of these transcripts in LK cells in an independent cohort of
Mx1

mice (

RNA(shRNA)-mediated depletion of these mRNAs in WT HSPCs (Figures

Ficara et al., 2008
;

associated with severe impairment of HSPC clonogenicity (

In addition to gene expression changes consistent with impaired
hematopoiesis in
Srsf2
P95H/+
Sf3b1
K700E/+
cells (
Figure 3F
), GO analysis also revealed a strong signature associated
with immune signaling that was augmented in double-relative to single-mutant
cells (Figures
​
(Figures5C
5C
and
S4G
). To functionally
evaluate these gene expression changes, we studied the response of
Srsf2
and
Sf3b1
mutant cells to
lipopolysaccharide (LPS). HSPCs from
Vav
-Cre
+
Srsf2
P95H/+
and
Vav
-Cre
+
Sf3b1
K700E/+
mice exhibited increased baseline
nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation (marked by increased nuclear
accumulation of phos-phorylated p65 [p-p65]) relative to
Vav
-Cre
+
WT HSPCs (Figures
​
(Figures5D

and
​
and5E),
5E
), and
this was further enhanced following
ex vivo
LPS stimulation in
double-mutant cells relative to single-mutant or WT cells (Figures
S5E
and
S5F
).
Given prior data identifying that chronic LPS exposure impairs
repopulating potential of HSPCs (
Esplin et al.,
2011
;
Zhao et al., 2013
), we
next evaluated the effects of chronic inflammation on the function of
Srsf2
or
Sf3b1
mutant BM HSPCs (
Figure 5F
).

every second day for 30 days followed by serial BMT into lethally irradiated
recipient mice. Chronic LPS treatment had a mild effect on the repopulating
potential of WT HSPCs, evidenced by similar peripheral blood and BM HSPC
chimerism in primary recipients (Figures
​
(Figures5G

and
​
and5H).

). In contrast, LPS-treated
Vav
-Cre
+
Srsf2
P95H/+
and
Vav
-Cre
+
Sf3b1
K700E/+
bm HSPCs showed significant reduction
in repopulating ability relative to vehicle-treated counterparts, and this
defect was further exacerbated following serial transplantation (Figures
​
(Figures5G
5G
and
​
and5H
5H
).
The above observations suggest that
Srsf2
and
Sf3b1
mutant HSPCs are intrinsically hypersensitive to
inflammatory stimuli that contribute to defective hematopoietic function,
rendering features observed in MDS patients. In addition, LPS-treated
Vav
-Cre
+
Srsf2
P95H/+
mice had enhanced myeloid skewing and
reduced B lymphopoiesis relative to vehicle-treated mice or
Vav
-Cre
+
Srsf2
+/+
mice treated with LPS (
Figure S5G
). Moreover,
acute
ex vivo
LPS stimulation of BM LSK cells from
Vav
-Cre
+
Srsf2
P95H/+
mice also resulted in significant
increase in nuclear p-p65 relative to
Vav
-Cre
+
Srsf2
+/+
LSK cells (Figures
S5H
and
S5I
). The enhanced
response to inflammatory stimuli in
Srsf2
and
Sf3b1
mutant mice
in vivo
was evident upon
LPS-induced sepsis. Exposure of primary
Mx1

Mx1
-Cre
+
Srsf2

mice with LPS (15 mg/kg) resulted in
accelerated death in both
Srsf2
- and Sf3b1-mutant mice relative
to WT controls (
Figure 5I
).
SF3B1 Mutations Promote Mis-splicing of MAP3K7, Resulting in Hyperactivation
of NF-κB Signaling
The above results identify that spliceosomal mutations are intolerable
when co-expressed but they are independently more sensitive to inflammatory
stimuli that converge on NF-κB signaling. To understand how spliceosome
gene mutations activate immune signaling pathways, we first focused on events
that are mis-spliced within SF3B1-mutant hematopoietic cells in both human and
mouse (
Table S7
).
Although recent studies reported few such shared mis-spliced events (
Mupo et al., 2016
;
Obeng et al., 2016
), we identified a larger set of
205 transcripts mis-spliced in both Sf3b1-mutant murine hematopoietic cells and
SF3S1-mutant MDS patients (
Figure 6A
). One
of the most robust mis-spliced events was MAP3K7, for which an intron-proximal
3′ splice site was promoted by mutant SF3B1 in both human and mouse
hematopoietic cells. Reanalysis of RNA-seq data from CLL patient cohorts (
DeBoever et al., 2015
) and isogenic cell
lines with endogenous mutations in
SF3B1
, as well as RT-PCR and
Sanger sequencing of cDNA from SF3B1-mutant cells, validated this isoform
(Figures
​
(Figures6B,
6B
,
​
,6C,
6C
, and
S6A
). This aberrant 3′ splice site recognition occurred in exon 5
of MAP3K7, which encodes part of the kinase domain, and is predicted to result
in an out-of-frame transcript that undergoes nonsense-mediated decay (Figures
S6B
and
S6C
). Consistent with
this, we observed reduced MAP3K7 protein in isogenic cell lines (Figures
​
(Figures6D
6D
and
​
and6E)
6E
) as well as patient BM mononuclear cells (MNCs) and peripheral blood
MNCs from MDS and CLL patients, respectively (Figures
6F
and

), with
SF3B1
mutations versus those lacking splicing-factor
mutations.

MAP3K7
encodes a kinase that mediates tumor necrosis
factor κ (TNFκ), interleukin-1 β (IL-1β), and
Toll-like receptor signaling through the NF-κB, JNK, and MAPK pathways.
The effects of MAP3K7 loss have been extensively studied and can result in loss
or promotion of inflammation depending on cellular context (
Ajibade et al., 2012
;
Lamothe et al., 2012
;
Sato et al.,
2005
;
Tang et al., 2008
;
Vink et al., 2013
;
Xin et al., 2017
). Here, we observed that
SF3B1
K700E
human myeloid or lymphoid leukemia
cells stimulated with LPS had enhanced NF-κB activation compared with
SF3B1
WT controls (Figures
​
(Figures6D,
6D
,

level was also evident at baseline in isogenic cells as well as primary patient
BM MNCs from SF3B1-mutant MDS and peripheral blood MNCs from
SF3B1
-mutant CLL relative to
SF3B1
WT
counterparts (Figures
​

). Increased nuclear p-p65 levels (

activity using a reporter assay (Figures

) were also
evident in
SF3B1

cells compared with

This was further confirmed by marked induction in NF-κB targets

Given that a number of aberrant splicing and gene expression events
occur in
SF3B1
-mutant cells, we next sought to understand the
contribution of MAP3K7 loss to hyperactivated NF-κB signaling. First,
hyperactive NF-κB signaling was confirmed using shRNA-mediated
downregulation of MAP3K7 in NALM-6 and K562 parental cells at the level of p-p65
signaling and NF-κB transcriptional activity at both baseline and after
LPS stimulation (Figures
​
(Figures7B
7B
and
S7B
). In addition,
re-expression of MAP3K7 in K562
SF3B1
K700E
cells
resulted in a significant decrease in p-p65 in both resting state as well as
following LPS exposure based on immunoblotting, NF-κB luciferase
reporter, and nuclear p-p65 level (Figures
​
(Figures7D,
7D
,
​
,7F,
7F
, and
S7C
). At a biological
level, restoration of Map3k7 expression in
Sf3b1
K700E/+
HSPCs resulted in mild rescue of
HSPC clonogenicity (
Figure
S7D
). Overall, these data suggest that the effects of
Sf3b1
K700E
mutation on induction of NF-κB
signaling are indeed, in part, mediated through aberrant splicing of MAP3K7.
SRSF2 Mutations Promote Aberrant Splicing of Caspase-8, Resulting in a
Truncated Protein that Hyperactivates NF-κB Signaling
Consistent with the distinct effects of
SF3B1
and
SRSF2
mutations on splicing, MAP3K7 aberrant splicing was
restricted to SF3B1-mutant cells (
Figure S8A
). We therefore searched for aberrant splicing
events in
SRSF2
-mutant cells that might affect NF-κB
signaling. One such event was aberrant splicing of caspase-8, encoded by
CASP8
, that was recurrently mis-spliced in AML and CMML
patients with
SRSF2
mutations, but not those bearing
SF3B1
mutations (Figures
​
(Figures8A
8A
and
S8B
). Caspase-8 is a cysteine protease that initiates
death-receptor-mediated apoptosis (
Shu et al.,
1997
;
Thome et al., 1997
) in
addition to regulating necroptosis and serving as a key activator of
NF-κB (
Chaudhary et al., 2000
;
Hu et al., 2000
;
Shikama et al., 2003
).
SRSF2
mutations repressed a cassette exon of caspase-8, as was evident by RNA-seq,
RT-PCR, qRT-PCR, and cDNA sequencing from cell lines and patient samples
(Figures
​
(Figures8A,
8A
,
​
,8B,
8B
, and
S8C–S8E
). CASP8 normally encodes a 54/55-kDa protein
containing two death-effector domains (DED) at the N terminus and a C-terminal
catalytic domain. Exclusion of this cassette exon results in an mRNA encoding a
truncated caspase-8 protein lacking the C-terminal catalytic domains, which was
readily detectable in SRSF2-mutant cells using an N-terminal anti-caspase-8
antibody (Figures
​
(Figures8C
8C
and
​
and8D).
8D
). Although several caspase-8 isoforms have been
described (
Xu et al., 2009
;
Yuan et al., 2012
), the specific isoform
detected in
SRSF2
-mutant cells is distinct from those
previously described.

.
Previously described DED-only forms of caspase-8 have been suggested to
serve either as competitive inhibitors or promoters of apoptosis (
Xu et al., 2009
;
Yuan et al., 2012
). Given this, we tested the effect
of this SRSF2-mutant-specific truncated isoform (hereafter referred to as
CASP8
TR
) in an
SRSF2
WT cell line followed by
TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) stimulation to engage the
death-receptor pathway. Overexpression of both caspase-8 full-length
(CASP8
FL
) and CASP8
TR
isoforms resulted in robust
expression of proteins at the expected size (Figures
​
(Figures8E
8E
and
S8F
) with no effect on cell growth (
Figure S8G
). Moreover,
both isoforms promoted TRAIL-mediated cell death, suggesting that the truncated
isoform did not affect cell death relative to CASP8
FL
(
Figure S8H
). Given this,
we next evaluated the effect of overexpressing CASP8
TR
on
NF-κB transcriptional activity, signaling, and nuclear localization. In
both K562 and HAP1 cells with endogenous caspase-8 expression, overexpression of
the CASP8
TR
, but not the CASP8
FL
isoform, resulted in
robust induction of NF-κB activity upon increasing concentration of TRAIL
(Figures
​
(Figures8E,
8E
,
​
,8F,
8F
,
S8I
,
and
S8J
). These data
were also confirmed in K562 cells with or without endogenous
Srsf2
P95H
mutation (Figures
​
(Figures8G,
8G
,
S8K
, and
S8L
). To rule out an effect of endogenous caspase-8, we assessed the
effect of CASP8
TR
on cell death and NF-κB activity in
CASP8
KO
HAP1 cells. Consistent with the lack of
the catalytic domain,
CASP8
KO
HAP1 cells expressing
CASP8
TR
isoform were unable to undergo TRAIL-mediated cell death
(Figures
S8M
and
S8N
); however, the
CASP8
TR
isoform was able to induce robust NF-κB signaling
in the absence of WT caspase-8 (Figures
​
(Figures8F
8F
,
S8O
, and
S8P
).DISCUSSION
Mutations affecting RNA splicing factors are the most common genetic
alterations in MDS but the basis for their significant enrichment in this disease
remains largely unexplained. Here we identify that two of the most commonly mutated
splicing factors in MDS converge on activation of innate immune signaling through
aberrant splicing of mRNAs encoding distinct enzymes.
Although the initial description of spliceosomal mutations predicted that
the mutually exclusive pattern of these mutations might be due to a common impact on
MDS pathogenesis (
Yoshida et al., 2011
), the
data here identify that these mutations are mutually exclusive, in part due to
synthetic lethal interaction. This provides one of the few examples of mutually
exclusive oncogenic alterations due to synthetic lethal interactions in cancer.
Interestingly, co-expression of
SF3B1
K700E
and
SRSF2
P95H
mutations resulted in impaired HSPC
self-renewal, differentiation, and survival, but this is not due to widespread
inhibition of splicing efficiency. Instead we identified aberrant splicing and
dysregulation of key regulators of HSPC function in double mutant cells, including
the thrombopoietin receptor c-Mpl, the homeodomain transcription factor Pbx1, and
integrin αIIb. Hematopoietic-specific deletion of these factors individually
has previously been shown to result in failure of hematopoiesis due to reduced HSC
self-renewal, increased apoptosis, and loss of quiescence (
Ficara et al., 2008
;
Gekas and Graf, 2013
;
Qian et al.,
2007
;
Yoshihara et al., 2007
), all
features characteristic of the double-mutant state.
Multiple lines of evidence implicate innate immune signaling in MDS
pathogenesis (
Basiorka et al., 2016
;
Fang et al., 2014
;
Wei et al., 2013
), including experiments demonstrating
increased innate immune signaling contributes to MDS development
in
vivo
(
Fang et al., 2017
;
Varney et al., 2015
). Increased activation of
Toll-like receptor and IL-1 receptor signaling with downstream activation of MAPK
and NF-κB pathways is widely reported in MDS, but the mechanistic basis for
this activation have mostly been restricted to MDS with deletion of chromosome 5q
(
Fang et al., 2014
, 2017;
Starczynowski, 2014
;
Varney et al., 2015
). Our work identifies a mechanism for hyperactivated
NF-κB signaling in a wider spectrum of MDS.
Although recent studies of
SF3B1
K700E
mutation
identified relatively few mRNAs mis-spliced in both mouse and human cells (
Mupo et al., 2016
;
Obeng et al., 2016
), we identified a much greater overlap
of aberrantly spliced transcripts shared across mouse and human
SF3B1
K700E
mutant hematopoietic cells than
previously reported. This includes aberrant splicing of MAP3K7 through the use of an
alternative 3′ splice site promoted by mutant SF3B1. As down regulation of
Map3k7 in myeloid cells promotes myeloid neoplasms, this finding is likely to be
relevant to SF3B1-mutant MDS. For example,
in vivo
knockdown of
Map3k7 resulted in splenomegaly, myeloproliferation, and extramedullary
hematopoiesis, as well as increased immune activation that was exacerbated by LPS
(
Vink et al., 2013
). Similarly,
myeloid-specific deletion of
Map3k7
heightened the response to
inflammatory stimuli and causes a clonal myeloid leukemia (
Ajibade et al., 2012
;
Eftychi et al., 2012
;
Lamothe et al.,
2012
;
Xin et al., 2017
).
Interestingly, the pro-inflammatory and leukemogenic effects of
Map3k7
loss appear to be restricted to myeloid lineages (
Ajibade et al., 2012
), in stark contrast to
pan-hematopoietic deletion of
Map3k7
, which results in complete
failure of hematopoiesis (
Tang et al., 2008
).
It will therefore be important to understand whether there is a differential
requirement for hematopoiesis in
SF3B1
mutant cells given the
partial loss of MAP3K7 induced by mutant
SF3B1
.
While aberrant splicing and downregulation of MAP3K7 was specific to SF3B1
mutant cells, cells expressing mutant SRSF2 shared similar elevated innate immune
signaling and hypersensitivity to LPS. This led us to identify a gain-of-function
effect of
SRSF2
mutations through generation of a C-terminal
truncated caspase-8 isoform that promotes NF-κB signaling. This is consistent
with prior work showing that N-terminal prodomain-only containing isoforms of
procaspase-8 activate NF-κB signaling through interactions with upstream
regulators of NF-κB, a function not mediated by canonical full-length
caspase-8 (
Chaudhary et al., 2000
;
Hu et al., 2000
;
Shikama et al., 2003
).
Together, our data demonstrate that different splicing-factor mutations
alter distinct targets at the level of pre-mRNA splicing that nonetheless converge
on the same downstream signaling node to hyperactivate innate immune signaling.STAR*METHODS

In Vitro
Colony-Forming Assays
Single-cell suspension was prepared from E14.5 fetal livers, and
25,000 cells from each embryo were plated in duplicates in
cytokine-supplemented methylcellulose medium (Metho Cult™ GF M3434;
Stem Cell Technologies), and colonies were enumerated 10-14 days later. To
assess the effect of shRNA-mediated knockdown of target genes, 8-12 week-old
C57BL/6 male mice were treated with 5-fluorouracil (150 mg/kg) via
intra-peritoneal injection. Five days after injection, BM cells were
harvested from the legs (femora and tibiae) and hip bones, and
lineage-depletion was performed with biotin-conjugated antibodies against
B220 (RA3-6B2), CD19 (1D3), CD3 (17A2), CD4 (GK1.5), CD8a (53-6.7), CD11b
(M1/70), Gr-1 (RB6-8C5), NK1.1 (PK136) and Ter119, labeled with anti-biotin
MicroBeads (130-090-485; Miltenyi Biotec), and lineage-negative
(Lin
−
) cells were magnetically separated using MACS
columns according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Lin

BM cells were cultured overnight in IMDM/10% FCS
supplemented with mIL-3 (10 ng/mL), mIL-6 (10 ng/mL) and mSCF (50 ng/mL).
The next day, cells were subjected to spinfection (2,700 rpm for 1 hr) with
retroviral supernatants containing shRNAs or cDNAs of interests in the
presence of polybrene (5 mg/mL; Millipore). 24 hr after spinfection, cells
that were successfully infected with retrovirus were marked with GFP, and
were purified by flow cytometry. FACS-sorted cells were cultured in
cytokine-supplemented methylcellulose medium (MethoCult™ GF M3434;
StemCell Technologies), and colonies were enumerated 10-14 days later.
Flow Cytometry Analyses
Cells were incubated with antibodies in PBS/2% BSA (without
Ca
2+
and Mg
2+
) for 45 min on ice. For
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell analysis from adult mouse bone
marrow, cells were stained with a lineage cocktail of monoclonal antibodies
including B220 (RA3-6B2), CD19 (1D3), CD3 (17A2), CD4 (GK1.5), CD8a
(53-6.7), CD11b (M1/70), Gr-1 (RB6-8C5), NK1.1 (PK136) and Ter119, allowing
for mature lineage exclusion from the analysis. For fetal liver analysis,
CD11b (M1/70) was excluded from the lineage depletion cocktail. Cells were
also stained with antibodies against c-Kit (2B8), Sca-1 (D7),
FcγRII/III (93), CD34 (RAM34), CD45.1 (A20), CD45.2 (104), CD48
(HM48-1) and CD150 (9D1). DAPI was used to exclude dead cells. The
composition of mature hematopoietic cell lineages in the bone marrow,
spleen, thymus and peripheral blood was assessed using a combination of
antibodies against B220, CD19, CD3, CD4, CD8a, CD11b, CD25 (PC61.5), CD44
(IM7), Gr-1, IgM (Il/41), CD43 (S11). All FACS sorting was performed on FACS
Aria, and analysis was performed on an LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences). Data
analysis was performed using the FlowJo software.
Cell Cycle and Apoptosis Analyses
For apoptosis assays, freshly harvested bone marrow or fetal liver
cells were first stained with antibodies against cell surface markers of
interests, and then stained with FITC-conjugated Annexin-V in Annexin-V
binding buffer (BD Pharmingen) according to manufacturer instructions. For
assessment of cell cycle status in adult bone marrow HSPCs, BrdU (1 mg/kg)
was administered via intra-peritoneal injection to adult mice 48 hr prior to
sacrifice. For cell cycle analysis of E14.5 fetal HSPCs, BrdU (1 mg/kg) was
administered to pregnant mice via intra-peritoneal injection 3 hr prior to
harvesting fetal livers. Assessment of BrdU incorporation was performed
following manufacturer instructions (BD Pharmingen) and data was acquired on
a LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences).
Histological Analysis
Tissues, embryos and pups were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,
processed routinely in alcohol and xylene, embedded in paraffin, sectioned
at 5-micron thickness, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E).
Multiple sections were obtained through the head in the coronal plane, trunk
in the transverse plane, and fore and hind limbs in the longitudinal plane.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on a Leica Bond RX automated
stainer (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). Following HIER at pH 6.0, the
primary antibody against mouse CD45 (BD Pharmingen; 550539), myeloperoxidase
(Dako; A0398), and cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling; 9661) were applied at
a concentration of 1:250,1:1000, and 1:250 respectively, followed by
application of a polymer detection system (DS9800, Novocastra Bond Polymer
Refine Detection, Leica Biosystems) in which the chromogen was 3,3
diaminobenzidine tetrachloride (DAB) and counterstain was hematoxylin. For
quantification of cleaved caspase-3 by image analysis, whole slide digital
images were generated on a slide scanner (Pannoramic 250 Flash III,
3DHistech, 20×/0.8NA objective, Budapest, Hungary) at a resolution of
0.2431 mm per pixel. Staining quantification was performed with Qu Path
0.1.2 software (Centre for Cancer Research & Cell Biology,
Queen’s University Belfast, UK). The region of interest (ROI) was
defined as the liver parenchyma. The number of DAB positive cells per
mm
2
was measured with the positive cell detection algorithm.
ROI selection and algorithm optimization and validation, and qualitative
examination of all H&E and IHC slides were performed by a
board-certified veterinary pathologist (S.M.).
Immunoblot
For immunoblotting, the following antibodies were used:
NF-κB/p65 (CST; 8242), phosphorylated NF-κB/p65-Ser536 (CST;
3033), IκB-α (CST; 9242), TAK1/MAP3K7 (CST; 5206), Caspase-8,
N-terminal (Abcam; clone E6), Caspase-8, C-terminal (Enzo Life Science;
clone 12F5), Flag (Sigma-Aldrich; F-1804), β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich;
A-5441).
Immunofluorescence
Following stimulation with LPS (Sigma-Aldrich), TNFα (Pepro
Tech), or TRAIL (Enzo Life Science), cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min at room temperature (RT), permeabilized with
PBS-T (PBS/1% BSA/0.2% Triton-X) for 15 min, blocked with PBS-T/5% goat
serum (Thermo Fisher PCN500) for 1 hr at RT, and incubated with primary
antibodies (1:50 dilution for p-p65 and 1:100 for Flag) in PBS-T/5% goat
serum overnight at 4°C. Cells were washed three times with PBS-T for
10 minutes at RT with gentle agitation, and were incubated with goat
anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; A-11012) or goat
anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; A-11001) secondary
antibodies (1:500 dilution in PBS-T/5/% normal goat serum) for 2 hr at RT in
the dark. Cells were then washed twice with PBS-T for 10 min at RT, and
counter-stained with DAPI (0.5 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich; D-9542) for 20 min at
RT. Cells were coverslipped with Pro Long Gold anti-fade (Thermo Fisher
Scientific;
{"type":"entrez-protein","attrs":{"text":"P36930","term_id":"1248281091","term_text":"P36930"}}
P36930
). Images were captured using either a confocal microscope
(Leica TCS SP5, Upright; Leica Micro Systems), or were digitally scanned
with a Pannoramic Confocal Scanner (3DHistech, Budapest Hungary) using a
20×/0.8NA objective. The projected images were exported into tif
format using Case Viewer software (3DHistech) and analyzed with Image
J/FIJI. A macro was written that segments each nucleus using the DAPI
channel and measures the p-p65 intensity within the nucleus after
appropriate threshold was set.
Caspase-8 and MAP3K7 Constructs
MSCV-Flag-CASP8

-IRES-GFP,
MSCV-Flag-CASP8
TR
-IRES-GFP, MSCV-Flag-MAK3K7-IRES-GFP (human),
MSCV-Flag-Map3k7-IRES-GFP (mouse) and MSCV-IRES-GFP empty vector constructs
were used for overexpression studies. Retroviral supernatants were produced
by transfecting 293 GPII cells with cDNA constructs and the packaging
plasmid VSV.G using XtremeGene9 (Roche), and were used to transduce HAP1,
CASP8
KO
HAP1 and K562 parental and
SF3B1
K700E
isogenic cells in the presence of
polybrene (5 mg/mL; Millipore). Successfully transduced cells expressing GFP
were purified by flow cytometry. Cells were stimulated with LPS
(Sigma-Aldrich), TNFα (Pepro Tech) or TRAIL (Enzo Life Science).
mRNA Stability Assay
For mRNA half-life measurement using qRT-PCR, UPF1 shRNA and control
lentivirus infected K562 SF3B1
K700E
cells were treated with 2.5
mg/ml Actinomycin D (Life Technologies) and harvested at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8
hr (following protocols established previously (
t Hoen et al., 2011
)). MAP3K7 inclusion, MAP3K7
exclusion and 18s rRNA mRNA levels were measured by qRT-PCR.
Luciferase Reporter Assay
We generated K562, NALM-6
SF3B1
isogenic cells,
HAP1 and CASP8
KO
HAP1 cells expressing the luciferase reporter
for NF-κB response elements by following the manufacturer
instructions (Cignal™ Reporter Assay, Qiagen). Cells were stimulated
with LPS, TNFα or TRAIL as described above, and NF-κB activity
was assessed by luciferase intensity using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter
Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer instructions. To verify
that the luciferase reporter assay was not aberrantly activated by basal
leakiness, we used another NF-κB reporter plasmids (Promega; N1111)
with known NF-κB response elements (RE), and performed mutagenesis in
the NF-κB-RE using the QuiK Change II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit
(Agilent Technologies; #200522). There are five putative NF-κB-RE
binding sites in this reporter plasmid (5′-GGGRNTTTCC-3′,
where R is a purine, Y is a pyrimidine and N is any nucleotide). To
mutagenize the binding sequence, the “TTTC” sequence was
mutated to “AAAA”. The primers used to create the two mutant
plasmids are:

RT-PCR and Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). For cDNA
synthesis, total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA with SuperScript VILO
cDNA synthesis kit (Life Technologies). The resulting cDNA was diluted 10-20
fold prior to use. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed in 10 mL
reactions with either SYBR Green PCR Master Mix orTaqman Gene Expression
Master Mix with AmpErase (ThermoFisher Scientific). All qRT-PCR analysis was
performed on an Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 6 Flex Cycler (ThermoFisher
Scientific). Relative gene expression levels were calculated using the
comparative CT method.

shRNA Experiments
NALM-6 parental cells carrying the NF-κB luciferase reporter
were transduced with a doxycycline-inducible lentiviral vector,
T3G-dsRED-mirE-PGK-Neo-IRES-rtTA3 (
Fellmann
et al., 2013
), expressing shRNAs for MAP3K7 ora non-targeting
renilla or firefly luciferase control. Transduced cells were selected with
G418 (0.5 mg/mL; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the short hairpins were
induced with the addition of doxycycline (2.0 mg/mL; Sigma Aldrich). All
mouse shRNAs used in clonogenic assays were cloned into the retroviral
pMSCV-LTR-mirE-PGK-SV40-IRES-GFP (MLS-E) backbone (
Fellmann et al., 2013
). All shRNAs were designed
using the Splash RNA algorithm (
Pelossof et

mRNA Isolation, Sequencing, and Analysis
RNA was extracted from sorted mouse cell populations using Qiagen R
Neasy columns. Poly(A)-selected, unstranded Illumina libraries were prepared
with a modified Tru Seq protocol. 0.5× AM Pure XP beads were added to
the sample library to select for fragments <400 bp, followed by
1× beads to select for fragments >100 bp. These fragments were
then amplified with PCR (15 cycles) and separated by gel electrophoresis (2%
agarose). 300 bp DNA fragments were isolated and sequenced on the Illumina
HiSeq 2000 (~100M 101 bp reads per sample).
Genome Annotations
Genome annotations for the human (NCBI GRCh37/UCSC hg19) and mouse
(NCBI GRCm38/UCSC mm10) genomes were created as previously described (
Dvinge et al., 2014
). Genome
annotations from the Ensembl (
Flicek et al.,
2013
) and UCSC (
Meyer et al.,
2013
) databases were merged with splicing event annotations from
MISO v2.0 (
Katz et al., 2010
). An
additional annotation of all possible combinations of annotated 5′
and 3′ splice sites found in the merged annotation was created for
read mapping. Constitutive introns were defined as those whose associated
5′ and 3′ splice sites were alternatively spliced in the UCSC
annotation.
RNA-seq Read Mapping
RNA-seq reads were sequentially mapped to the transcriptome and
genome as previously described (
Dvinge et
al., 2014
). Reads were first mapped to the transcriptome using
Bowtie v1.0.0 (
Langmead et al., 2009
)
and RSEM v1.2.4 (
Li and Dewey, 2011
).
The resulting read alignments were then filtered to require that reads
spanning splice junctions overlapped the flanking exons by at least six nt.
The remaining unaligned reads were then mapped to the genome and splice
junctions using TopHat v2.0.8b(
Trapnell et
al., 2009
), where reads were only allowed to align to the splice
junctions present in the file of all possible combinations of annotated
5′ and 3′ splice sites described above. The resulting read
alignments were then merged with the output of RSEM’s alignment to
create a final file of aligned reads.
Differential Gene Expression Analysis
Gene expression analysis was performed using the gene expression
estimates computed by RSEM in units of transcripts per million (TPM). Those
estimates were then further normalized using the TMM method (
Robinson and Oshlack, 2010
), with a reference set
of all protein-coding genes. Differentially expressed genes were defined as
those with an associated Bayes factor ≥ 100 (computed using
Wagenmakers’s Bayesian framework (
Wagenmakers et al., 2010
)) and an associated fold-change
≥ 1.5.
Differential Splicing Analysis
Isoform ratios for annotated splicing events (cassette exons,
competing 5′ and 3′ splice sites, and annotated retained
introns) were calculated using MISO v2.0 (
Katz et al., 2010
). Splicing of constitutively spliced introns
and junctions was quantified using only junction-spanning reads, as
previously described (
Hubert et al.,
2013
). Differential splicing in the murine data was identified by
comparing samples from different genotypes for a single replicate in a
pairwise fashion. The analysis was restricted to splicing events with at
least 20 informative reads, where an informative read is defined as a read
that distinguishes between isoforms. Differentially spliced events were
defined as those with an associated Bayes factor was ≥ 5 (computed
using Wagenmakers’s Bayesian framework (
Wagenmakers et al., 2010
)) and absolute change in
isoform ratio of ≥ 10%. Differential splicing in the human patient
cohorts was identified using a group statistical test to identify
differences between patient samples with or without defined splicing factor
mutations. Differentially spliced events were defined as those with an
associated p value ≥ 0.05 (computed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test)
and an absolute change in median per-group isoform ratio of ≥
10%.
Gene Ontology (GO) Enrichment Analysis
GO enrichment analysis was performed using the GOseq method (
Young et al., 2010
) to correct for
sequencing depth biases. The background set of genes was defined as all
protein-coding genes. False discovery rates were calculated using the
Wallenius method and corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. We
restricted reporting of enriched terms to those with at least two ancestors
and fewer than 500 associated genes.
Motif Enrichment Analysis and Sequence Logos
The relative enrichment of different ESEs was computed by comparing
motif occurrence within and adjacent to cassette exons that were promoted
versus repressed in cells or samples with versus without defined splicing
factor mutations. These analyses were performed using all cassette exons
that were differentially spliced in at least one mouse replicate for a given
genotype comparison. 95% confidence intervals were calculated by
bootstrapping with 500 resampling steps. Sequence logos centered on
intron-proximal or intron-distal 3′ splice sites were created using
all competing 3′ splice sites that were differentially spliced in at
least one mouse replicate for a given genotype comparison. The analysis was
restricted to events with canonical GT and AG dinucleotides at the 5′
and 3′ splice sites. These analyses relied upon the Genomic Ranges
package in Bioconductor (
Huber et al.,
2015
).
Analysis of Expected and Observed Gene Expression Convergence
Expected gene expression programs for
Mx1
-Cre
+
Srsf2
P95H/+
Sf3b1
K700E/+
samples were calculated by
computing the mean of individual gene expression levels between
Mx1
-Cre
+
Srsf2
P95H/+
and
Mx1
-Cre
+
Sf3b1
K700E/+
samples for each replicate. This
method of computing the expected gene expression program was motivated by
the assumption that mutations in
Srsf2
and
Sf3b1
have independent consequences for individual gene
expression. Gene dysregulation for the expected gene expression program was
then calculated as described previously for the actual, observed gene
expression values.
The numbers of dysregulated genes that were convergent between the
expected gene expression program and the two
Mx1
-Cre
+
Srsf2

and
Mx1

+
Sf3b1

single mutants was then determined
for each replicate, again using a method identical to that for the actual,
observed gene expression values (
Figure S4A
). A one-sided binomial proportion test was
then used to test whether there were more dysregulated genes that were
observed than expected (
Figure S4B
).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical Analyses
All data are presented as mean±standard deviation, unless
otherwise stated. The replicate for each experiment was stated in the figure
legend or indicated in the figure. Statistical significance was determined
by analysis of variance (ANOVA) after testing for normal distribution and
equal variance, followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test for multiple group
comparisons. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically
significant. For non-normally distributed data, a non-parametric test
(Kruskal-Wallis) was used, followed by multiple group comparisons using
false-discovery rate (FDR). For Kaplan Meier survival analysis, Mantel-Cox
log-ranked test was used to determine statistical significance. For
offspring frequency analysis, a Chi-Square test was performed to test the
difference between observed and expected frequencies from different
genotypes. No blinding or randomization was used. Unless otherwise noted,
all immunoblot quantitation and immunofluorescence image quantitation were
representative of at least three biological replicates from independent
experiments. Data were plotted using Graph Pad Prism 7 software.

Significance
Mutual exclusivity of different mutations that affect a single pathway in
cancer is commonly thought to indicate convergent effects of these mutations. RNA
splicing-factor mutations constitute the most common class of alterations in
patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and are also frequent in several additional
cancer types, and occur as heterozygous mutations at restricted residues in a
mutually exclusive manner. The mutual exclusivity of spliceosomal mutations suggests
synthetic lethal and/or convergent biological effects of these mutations; however,
there is currently no functional evidence supporting either of these possibilities.
Here we report that individual spliceosomal mutations have non-overlapping effects
on splicing and are mutually exclusive due to both synthetic lethal interactions and
convergent effects on hyperactivation of innate immune signaling.Supplementary Material
