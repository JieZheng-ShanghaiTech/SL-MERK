-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
 Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

Entity_types: [gene, protein, pathway, disease, organism]
Text:
In the study, TP53 mutations were found to play a significant role in breast cancer development. 
BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were also heavily implicated, particularly in hereditary cases. The p53 protein, encoded by the TP53 gene, is crucial in regulating the cell cycle and preventing tumor formation. 
BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins are involved in DNA repair, which is essential for maintaining genomic stability. 
A malfunction in these genes can lead to the activation of oncogenic pathways such as the PI3K/AKT pathway, further driving the progression of breast cancer.

Text:
They were no longer mere operatives; they had become guardians of a threshold, keepers of a message from a realm beyond stars and stripes. This elevation in their mission could not be shackled by regulations and established protocols—it demanded a new perspective, a new resolve.

Tension threaded through the dialogue of beeps and static as communications with Washington buzzed in the background. The team stood, a portentous air enveloping them. It was clear that the decisions they made in the ensuing hours could redefine humanity's place in the cosmos or condemn them to ignorance and potential peril.

Their connection to the stars solidified, the group moved to address the crystallizing warning, shifting from passive recipients to active participants. Mercer's latter instincts gained precedence— the team's mandate had evolved, no longer solely to observe and report but to interact and prepare. A metamorphosis had begun, and Operation: Dulce hummed with the newfound frequency of their daring, a tone set not by the earthly

Example 3:

Entity_types: [gene, protein, pathway, disease, cell type, organism, biological process]
Text:
In their groundbreaking study, the researchers identified the BRCA1 gene as a critical factor in breast cancer development. 
The protein encoded by BRCA1 plays a key role in DNA repair, and mutations in this gene can lead to a malfunction in the repair process, significantly increasing the risk of developing the disease. 
The study also highlighted the involvement of the p53 protein in the pathway regulating cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, further underscoring the complexity of cancer progression. 
The research was conducted using human epithelial cells, which are commonly studied in cancer research due to their relevance to tumor formation.
