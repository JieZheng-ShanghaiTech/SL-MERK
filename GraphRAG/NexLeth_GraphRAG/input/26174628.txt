, which inhibits CDK4/6 and PI3K-δ and exhibits potent activity against mantle cell lymphomas (MCLs) both
in vitro
and
in vivo
. We examined the effects of PD0332991 and ON 123300 on cell cycle progression, modulation of the Rb and PI3K/AKT pathways, and the induction of apoptosis in MCL cell lines and patient-derived samples. When Granta 519 and Z138C cells were incubated with PD0332991 and

also triggered apoptosis and inhibition of the Rb and PI3K/AKT pathways, suggesting that this compound might be an effective agent in MCL, including ibrutinib-resistant forms of the disease.

mantle cell lymphoma, CYCLIN D, CDK4, RB, PI3K, targeted therapyIntroduction
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a well-defined and aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma that is genetically characterized by the t(11;14)(q13;q32) chromosomal translocation which results in constitutive over-expression of CYCLIN D1
1
–
3
. CYCLIN D1 over-expression is considered to be a hallmark of MCL, and is closely correlated with the proliferative rate of these malignant cells
4
. Because CYCLIN D1 over-expression has been shown to be the most common feature of MCL, PD0332991 (palbococlib), a selective CDK4/6 inhibitor
5
, has been tested in Phase I/II clinical trials as a targeted therapy for MCL. Unfortunately, as a single agent, PD0332991 was reported to be cytostatic and hence, resulted in only stabilization of the disease with very few objective clinical responses
6
,
7
. Despite these shortcomings, this agent has been found to sensitize MCL cells to other cytotoxic drugs due to the fact that MCLs frequently exhibit lesions in other signaling pathways including those mediated by the B-cell receptor (BCR), phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K), WNT, NOTCH and TGF-β
8
,
9
Of these, dysregulated PI3K signaling is one of the most widely studied and represents an attractive druggable target.
Class I PI3Ks are the major activators of the AKT serine-threonine kinase and are sub-divided into class IA and IB kinases
10
. Of the three class IA subtypes, PI3K-α, PI3K-β, and PI3K-δ, both the α and δ isoforms play critical roles in immune signaling of normal cells. While PI3k-δ is lineage restricted, expressed at high levels in B-lymphocytes and transmits signals from the BCR, PI3K-α plays a ligand-independent role in this process. Furthermore, both isoforms are mediators of agonist-independent, constitutive BCR signaling that occurs in MCL
11
–
13
. Studies have shown that MCLs constitutively activate the PI3K-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and that this signaling module plays a key role in the aggressive blastoid variant of the disease
13
–
15
. Furthermore, in the case of refractory disease, both PI3K-α and PI3K-δ are also involved in ligand-independent activation of this pathway
13
. Ibrutinib (PCI-32765, Imbruvica
®
), an inhibitor of the Burton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), has been remarkably successful in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and has recently been approved for the treatment of certain refractory or relapsed MCL cases. Notably, this drug effectively induces complete remission in approximately 21% of these patients
16
and is thought to do so, in part, by indirectly inhibiting PI3K-δ mediated signals. As a result, several PI3K-δ inhibitors are now in various stages of clinical trials for the treatment of MCL and other B-cell malignancies
17
,
18
. In spite of ibrutinib’s efficacy, acquired resistance to the drug is beginning to emerge in the clinic. Whole exome sequencing has revealed the presence of a single point mutation in the BTK ibrutinib binding site, C481S, which results in enhanced BTK and AKT activities in ibrutinib-treated patients with relapsed MCL
19
. Furthermore, subsets of patients that exhibit primary resistance or respond temporarily to the drug underscore the need to overcome alternate mechanisms of ibrutinib-resistance
19
.
Owing to the near complete dysfunction of the CYCLIN D1/CDK4/Rb pathway and activation of the PI3K/AKT pro-survival pathway in most MCLs, recent studies have focused on combination therapies targeting both signaling modules. These studies have shown that treatment of MCL cells with PD0332991 induces G
1
arrest of cells and sensitizes them to selective PI3K-δ inhibitors, such as GS-1101 (idelalisib, CAL-101)
20
. It is hypothesized that cells that are blocked in G
1
by CDK4/6 inhibition allows for sustained inhibition of PI3K-δ that is unlikely to be overcome by compensation of other PI3K isoforms
19
,
20
.
Towards the goal of inhibiting both CYCLIN D/CDK4/Rb and PI3Kδ in MCL, we recently developed a dual inhibitor of both pathways,

21
, and examined its effects on the growth and apoptosis of MCL cell lines. Our studies show that unlike PD0332991, treatment with
{"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"ON123300","term_id":"2214659616","term_text":"ON123300"}}

was cytotoxic and induced apoptosis of MCL cell lines and patient-derived MCLs. Our studies also show that
{"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"ON123300","term_id":"2214659616","term_text":"ON123300"}}
ON123300
was effective in reducing the tumor burden in mouse xenograft models of MCL in the absence of adverse side effects.Materials/Subjects and Methods
MCL Patient Samples
Primary human lymphoma samples were obtained either as part of standard excisional biopsy or from peripheral blood samples from patients at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai with informed and written consent for tissue banking following a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board (MSSM IRB#11-1669) and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Specimens were processed to viable, sterile single-cell suspensions. Briefly, lymph node tissue was diced and forced through a metal sieve in a laminar flow hood into RPMI medium. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells or disaggregated mantle cell lymphoma biopsy cells were pelleted by low-speed centrifugation, resuspended in media composed of 90% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10% DMSO (Sigma), frozen slowly in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen in multiple cryovials, and stored in liquid nitrogen.
Cell Lines
Cell lines were obtained from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) or RPMI (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C under humidified conditions and 5% CO

Derivation of a small molecule inhibitor of MCL growth
We recently synthesized a large number (approximately 3,000) of novel ATP mimetics, some of which contained the basic backbone shown in
Fig. 1A
and exhibited potent CDK4 inhibitory activity
21
. These compounds were tested in
in vitro
tissue culture growth inhibitory (GI
50
) assays against a panel of cell clines representing a variety of tumor types. This screen revealed that one of these compounds, ON0123300, exhibited 10–100-fold higher cytotoxicities against MCL cell lines as compared to those of other tumors (
Table 1
). Subsequent testing of this compound by Reaction Biology Corp (Malvern, PA) for activity against a series of 285 functional kinases revealed that
{"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"ON123300","term_id":"2214659616","term_text":"ON123300"}}
ON123300
is a multi-kinase inhibitor
21
, with highest activity against CDK4 and ARK5 (
Table 2
), two kinases intimately associated with growth, survival and metastasis of human tumor cells
22
,
23
. In addition to these kinases, this compound was shown to inhibit PI3K-δ, with an IC

of 144nM (

{"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"ON123300","term_id":"2214659616","term_text":"ON123300"}}
ON123300
is a potent inhibitor of CDK4, with an IC
50
of 3.8nM, with little inhibitory activity against CDKs 1,2,5 and 8 (data not shown). As a positive control, we used PD0332991, a commercially available CDK4 inhibitor, which is highly selective towards CDK4 and CDK6 and is currently in various phases of clinical trials
5
,
7
. Kinase inhibition assays showed that PD0332991 showed similar inhibition of CDK4 with an IC
50
of 5.36nM (

). However, when these assays were performed using PI3K-δ,
{"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"ON123300","term_id":"2214659616","term_text":"ON123300"}}
ON123300
inhibited the kinase with an IC

ON123300
and PD0332991 treatment on the cell cycle progression of MCL cell lines. For these studies, Z138C cells were cultured in the presence of increasing concentrations of

ON123300
or PD0332991 for 24 hours. The cells were then harvested and subjected to propidium iodide staining and flow cytometric analysis.
Figure 2A
shows the distribution of cells in various phases of the cell cycle. DMSO-treated cells served as negative controls. In the absence of drug, the majority of cells were in the G
1
phase of the cell cycle with smaller percentages of the population in the S and G
2
phases (
Fig. 2A
). As expected, a rapid accumulation of the cells in the G
1
phase of the cell cycle was evident following treatment with PD0332991 (
Fig. 2A
), with little or no accumulation of cells in the sub-G
1
phase. While cells treated with

also accumulated in the G

phase at lower concentrations (0.1–1.0µM), at higher concentrations of the compound, a large proportion of the cells progressed through the S and G

induced apoptosis in MCL cells, the levels of caspases 3, 7 and 9 as well as PARP cleavage were determined by Western blot analysis. The results presented in
Figure 2B and C
show that while there is no evidence of apoptosis in PD0332991-treated cells, we could readily see PARP cleavage in cells treated with
{"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"ON123300","term_id":"2214659616","term_text":"ON123300"}}
ON123300
at concentrations greater than or equal to 2.5µM for 24 hrs. We also observed decreases in the levels of full-length forms of caspases 3, 7 and 9, which are cleaved into their active forms upon the onset of apoptotic cell death.
Because

ON123300
induced growth arrest and cell death over a 96 hr period at concentrations of 25–50nM, we repeated these studies using lower concentrations of the compound. These studies showed that incubation of the Granta 519 and Z138C cell lines with PD0332991 for 72–96 hrs did not show any PARP cleavage, while similar incubation of these cells with identical concentrations of

readily resulted in PARP cleavage (data not shown). These results confirm previous studies

and suggest that while PD0332991 induces effective growth arrest of MCL cell lines, it is not accompanied by apoptosis. On the other hand, while

It is now well established that the Retinoblastoma family of proteins (pRb, Rb2/p107 and p130) are primary targets of CDK4
7
. It is therefore highly likely that phosphorylation of Rb family proteins is inhibited due to inhibition of CDK4 in MCL cells treated with PD0332991 or

or PD0332991 for 24 hours. Whole cell extracts were subjected to western blot analysis using antibodies directed against Rb and p130 and their phosphorylated forms as well as CDK4, CDK2 and p21. The results of this study, presented in

as well as PD0332991) inhibited the phosphorylation of pRb and p130 in a dose- dependent manner. Although the levels of CYCLIN D1 declined as a function of ON0123300 concentration, these results are in agreement with previous studies showing that inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling leads to loss of CYCLIN D1 expression

. p107 levels were extremely low in both cell lines, making it difficult to determine the effects of both ON0123300 and PD0332991 on its phosphorylation status (data not shown). While the levels of CDK4 and CDK2 were unaffected in cells treated with

ON123300
is a multi-kinase inhibitor, it is possible that some of its anti-tumor activity might be associated with its ability to inhibit MAPK and/or NF-kB pathways. To test this possibility, we examined the phosphorylation status of MEK and ERK1 & 2 kinases whose activation is mediated by growth factor receptors. These studies, presented in
supplemental Fig. 1

on primary tumor samples, we collected peripheral blood by apheresis from MCL patients with leukemic disease.

We also analyzed the levels of Rb and AKT phosphorylation in these samples.

in the plasma. These studies show that the area under the curve (AUC) values were 7.18 and 2.78µg/ml/hr in mice that received the drug via ip injection and oral gavage (po), respectively, which reflect concentrations of 16.71 (ip) and 6.47µM/ml/hr (po) in the plasma. Because the plasma concentration of

The pathogenesis of MCL is characterized by cell cycle dysregulation, with CYCLIN D1 overexpression being a hallmark of this disease. Cyclin D1 complexes with its catalytic partners, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4 and 6, driving retinoblastoma (Rb) protein phosphorylation and G
1
cell-cycle progression
32
. Initial studies with PD0332991 (palbococlib), a selective small molecule inhibitor of CYCLIN D- associated CDK4/6 inhibitor activity
5
, demonstrated potent inhibition of Rb phosphorylation and G
0
/G
1
cell cycle arrest in the absence of any associated apoptosis
24
. In accordance, the drug was cytostatic in a Phase I/II clinical trial for MCL and resulted in disease stabilization with an 18% overall response rate
6
. Although PI3K signaling is activated in MCL, in a Phase I trial, idelalisib (GS-1101), a selective PI3K-δ inhibitor, was also modestly effective as a single agent in patients with refractory disease
33
. In spite of these outcomes, PD0332991 has been shown to sensitize MCL cell lines to PI3K-δ inhibition, in part, by enhancing the effect of the loss/reduction of AKT phosphorylation when the cells are arrested in the G
1
phase
17
,
19
,
20
.
In this communication, we examined the effects of
{"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"ON123300","term_id":"2214659616","term_text":"ON123300"}}
ON123300
, a dual inhibitor of CDK4 and PI3K-δ on MCL cell growth and compared its activity with PD0332991, a highly specific CDK4/6 inhibitor. Our results show that while both inhibitors induce G
1
arrest of MCLs, only
{"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"ON123300","term_id":"2214659616","term_text":"ON123300"}}
ON123300
elicits an apoptotic response from these tumor cells. The G
1
arrest mediated by the two compounds studied here is clearly due to inhibition of phosphorylation of members of the Rb family, a direct result of CDK4 and CDK6 inhibition by both compounds. Our results also show that in contrast to PD0332991,
{"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"ON123300","term_id":"2214659616","term_text":"ON123300"}}
ON123300
acts as a potent inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, leading to the activation of apoptotic pathways, as assayed by caspase activation and PARP cleavage. Our results also show that
{"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"ON123300","term_id":"2214659616","term_text":"ON123300"}}
ON123300
treatment results in inhibition of FOXO1 phosphorylation, a target of mTOR (
Figure 4
). Dephosphorylation of FOXO1 is known to regulate the transcriptional activity of this protein, which has been shown to activate apoptotic pathways and cell cycle arrest
15
,
30
. Together, these studies provide a molecular basis for the observed induction of apoptosis

{"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"ON123300","term_id":"2214659616","term_text":"ON123300"}}
ON123300
markedly inhibited tumor growth over a 14-day period, further suggesting that this compound could be a possible candidate for the initiation of clinical trials. Previous studies have demonstrated that
{"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"ON123300","term_id":"2214659616","term_text":"ON123300"}}
ON123300
readily crosses the blood-brain barrier
34
,
35
, and considering the fact that a small percentage of MCL patients experience lymphomatous spread to the meninges and central nervous system
36
, this agent could also be useful for patients with CNS involvement.
Recent studies have shown that constitutive activation of BCR signaling via PI3 kinases is essential for the proliferation of a large portion of MCLs, particularly in relapsed or refractory disease
37
. This observation was further supported by the finding that ibrutinib, a covalent inhibitor of BTK, has a profound effect on disease progression of MCL patients
16
. MCLs that acquire resistance to or relapse from treatment with ibrutinib due to the BTK
C481S
mutation, as well as those that exhibit primary resistance to the drug show increased AKT and ERK activition
19
,
38
. Interestingly, these drug-resistant MCLs exhibit a bias in CDK4-driven proliferation, which is sensitive to combined inhibition of the CDK4 and PI3K pathways
19
. We examined the effects of
{"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"ON123300","term_id":"2214659616","term_text":"ON123300"}}
ON123300
on primary tumor samples that were derived from MCL patients who either responded to ibrutinib or who acquired resistance following ibrutinib treatment. Both cell types were sensitive to the pro-apoptotic effects of
{"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"ON123300","term_id":"2214659616","term_text":"ON123300"}}

as measured by increased Annexin V staining and reductions in the levels of phospho-Rb, phospho-AKT and S6RB phosphorylation, consistent with inhibition of the mTOR pathway. These results suggest that
{"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"ON123300","term_id":"2214659616","term_text":"ON123300"}}
ON123300
is likely to be an effective treatment option for both ibrutinib-responsive and resistant patients.Supplementary Material
