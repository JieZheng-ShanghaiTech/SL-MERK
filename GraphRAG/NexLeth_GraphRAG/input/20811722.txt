Abstract. Activation to a large extent of the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway and mutations in the
p53 gene are involved in lung cancer therapeutic resistance.
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) acts as a downstream
effector for Akt. Activation of the Akt/mTOR signal
is a contributing factor to decreased radiation sensitivity. The
purpose of this study was to examine whether the effect of
rapamycin on radiation sensitivity is affected by cellular p53
gene status. Cellular radiation sensitivity was evaluated by
using two human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell
lines with the same genetic background except for their p53
gene status (H1299/wtp53 and H1299/mp53). The cells were
treated with rapamycin and/or radiation. Cell viability, cell
proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle and Akt/mTOR signaling
activity were explored. Rapamycin synergistically enhanced
the cytotoxicity of radiation, promoting the induction of
apoptosis. Moreover, the combined treatment augmented the
cytostatic effects of radiation regardless of cellular p53 gene
status. Rapamycin in combination with radiation increased
G1 arrest and suppressed progression to S phase in both cell
lines. Furthermore, the combined treatment conduced to a
prominent p53-independent down-regulation of the mTOR
signal and pro-survival molecule, cyclin D1. Rapamycin can
enhance the effect of radiation through the repression of prosurvival
signals and the reduction in the apoptotic threshold.
Taken together, inhibition of the mTOR signal may be a
promising strategy for radiosensitization with no relevance to
p53 gene status from the aspects of cell lethality and cell
growth depression.

Introduction

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths
worldwide (1). High mortality rates seen in lung cancer reflects
its invasive nature and its resistance to current treatment
modalities. Most patients with lung cancer are diagnosed at
advanced stages and are not cured with a 5-year relative
survival rate of 15% (1). Systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy
are the two mainstays of treatment for inoperable
advanced disease. Although radiotherapy is applied for local
disease control, the beneficial effect of current radiotherapy
seems to be restricted to initial responders alone. Most patients
will relapse due to the development of radiation resistance
and lack of an adequate salvage therapy. This dismal prognosis
has prompted a search for new therapeutic strategies.
Radiation resistance in tumors is associated with the
activation of cell survival pathways, aberrations in tumor
suppressor genes, and DNA damage repair mechanisms
(2,3). The PI3K/Akt pathway represents a major cell survival
pathway and plays a critical role in oncogenesis and tumor
cell growth (4). Recent studies have reported that Akt
activation contributes to resistance to radiation, chemotherapy
and tyrosine kinase inhibitors by promoting survival
signals which protect cancer cells from undergoing apoptosis
(5-8). It has been shown that inhibition of PI3k/Akt through
pharmacologic or genetic means induces antiproliferative
effects on certain NSCLC cell lines in vitro and in vivo
(9,10). Similarly, it has been demonstrated that inhibition of
Akt activity, by pharmacologic or genetic approaches, greatly
improves the cellular response to radiation in NSCLC cells
(11). Although inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signal may be a
promising strategy to enhance the effect of radiation, there
are concerns about the possible side-effects of inhibiting
these upstream proteins.
The mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR, is a 289-kDa
serine-threonine kinase which acts as a downstream effector
for Akt (12). It regulates key processes such as cell growth
and proliferation, cell cycle progression and protein translation
through two distinct pathways: one involving the ribosomal
p70S6 kinase (p70S6K), and one involving eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binding proteins

(4E-BPs) (13). A recent study has reported that frequent Akt
activation and mTOR phosphorylation occurs in NSCLC, and
Akt activation is closely associated with the up-regulation of
mTOR activity (14). It has been suggested that dysregulation
of mTOR contributes to lung cancer progression (15,16).
Alterations in protein synthesis, aberrant cell cycle signaling
and inhibition of apoptosis mediated by mTOR may play a
critical role (13). Therefore, mTOR may be a potential
therapeutic target to inhibit or block the PI3K/Akt pathway.
Several mTOR inhibitors are currently under development:
rapamycin and its derivatives CCI-770, AP23573 and
RAD001. Antiproliferative effects of mTOR inhibitors have
been shown to occur in various tumor cells in vitro and
in vivo (17-19). These mTOR inhibitors are generally regarded
as cytostatic agents, because they induce G1 cell cycle arrest,
but not apoptosis (17). Previous studies have reported that
cellular sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors has been linked to
mutations of PTEN or to Akt activation (20-23). It has been
suggested that high levels of Akt activity result in hypersensitivity
to mTOR inhibition in several tumors (19,24).
Recent studies have shown that activation of the Akt/
mTOR signal is a contributing factor to decreased radiation
sensitivity, and that mTOR inhibitors were able to sensitize
some tumor cell lines to radiation (25,26).
The p53 tumor suppressor gene is activated by DNAdamaging
agents such as ionizing radiation (27). This gene
regulates proliferation and survival in cells with damaged
DNA by modulating the transcription of p53-target genes,
which can lead to G1 arrest or apoptosis. Mutations in the p53
gene are the most common genetic change found in human
lung cancer (in ~70% of small cell lung cancer and in 50% of
NSCLC, respectively) (28) and these mutations are frequently
associated with drug resistance and radiation resistance (2).
As previously reported, H1299 (NSCLC) cells with a mutated
p53 gene (mp53 gene) were more resistant to radiation than
wild-type cells (29,30). Recent reports have demonstrated
that mTOR inhibitors can enhance the cytotoxic effects of
chemotherapeutic agents and radiation in many human
cancers (24-26). There are several reports which discuss the
dependence of chemosensitization by mTOR inhibitors on
cellular p53 gene status. However, whether mTOR-mediated
radiosensitization depends on p53 status is still uncertain. In
examining the relation of mTOR-mediated chemosensitization
to p53 status, some conflicting results in various tumor cells
have been reported. Rapamycin was found to sensitize lung
cancer cells with a wild-type p53 gene (wtp53) to cisplatininduced
apoptosis by inhibiting p21 translation (17). In
contrast, RAD001 enhanced the sensitivity of ovarian cancer
cells to cisplatin in a p53-independent manner (24). Moreover,
rapamycin chemosensitization of tumor cells with a mutant
p53 was reported in ovarian and breast cancer cells (31,32).
In particular, a recent study has shown that RAD001 was
able to enhance the sensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) cells to cisplatin in both, a p53-dependent and p53-
independent manner (33). It seems possible that understanding
the mechanism through which rapamycin functions
could lead to improved therapeutic effects in the treatment of
radioresistant tumors. Although the effects of p53 status on
chemosensitization by mTOR inhibitors may be tumor typespecific,
it seems likely that such factors as a genetically

heterogeneous background may have affected previous work
in this field.
The aim of this study was to learn if the effect of rapamycin
on radiation sensitivity is affected by cellular p53 gene status
in two human NSCLC cell lines with the same genetic
background except for their p53 gene status. These cell lines
exhibit different radiation sensitivities which presumably
derive from their differing p53 status (29). In addition, molecular
mechanisms underlying radiosensitization by mTOR
inhibition were also to be investigated.

Materials and methods

Cell lines and cell culture. Human H1299 cells, a non-small
cell lung cancer cell line with a deleted p53 gene (provided
by Dr Moshe Oren, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot,
Israel) were stably transfected with either a wtp53 gene or an
mp53 gene [in which codon 248 is altered to code for Trp
(TGG) rather than Arg (CGG)]. The cell lines with a wtp53
or an mp53 gene are designated H1299/wtp53 or H1299/
mp53 cells, respectively (34). These resulting H1299/wtp53
and H1299/mp53 cell lines were kindly provided by Dr
Hideki Matsumoto (Fukui University). H1299/mp53 cells
have lost p53 functions such as the induction of apoptosis
and p53-regulated gene products after X-irradiation. All cells
were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (MP
Biomedicals Inc., Illkirch, France) containing 10% (v/v) fetal
bovine serum (MP Biomedicals Inc.), 20 μmol/ml 2-[4-
(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl] ethanesulfonic acid (Nacalai
Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), 50 U/ml penicillin (Meiji Seika
Kaisha Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Meiji
Seika Kaisha Ltd.), and 50 μg/ml kanamycin (Nacalai
Tesque) (DMEM-10). The doubling time of these cell lines
was ~24 h. Exponentially growing cells grown to a density of
~80% of confluency were used for each experiment, and were
cultured at 37˚C in a conventional humidified CO2 incubator.

Drug preparation. Rapamycin was purchased from Calbiochem
(San Diego, CA). Rapamycin was dissolved in DMSO at a
concentration of 1 mM and stored at -20˚C. A stock solution
was diluted to the appropriate concentration in serum containing
culture medium just before addition to cell cultures. The drug
was used at a final concentration of 0.01% of the vehicle.

Treatment with rapamycin and/or radiation. Exponentially
growing cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes or in 25-cm2 flasks
containing DMEM-10 and cultured overnight. The day after
plating, cell cultures were prepared for individual experiments
as follows: DMSO alone as a control, a single treatment
(rapamycin or radiation alone), or a combined treatment with
rapamycin and radiation. Cells used for each treatment were
pretreated with either DMSO (0.01%) or rapamycin (100 nM)
for 1 h at 37˚C in a CO2 incubator. Cells were irradiated
with 0-9 Gy as indicated, at a dose rate of 1.2 Gy/min with a
150-kVp X-ray generator (Model MBR-1520R; Hitachi,
Tokyo, Japan). Following X-irradiation, culture medium was
replaced with fresh medium and the cells were returned to a
37˚C incubator for further growth.

Colony formation assay. Exponentially growing cells were
treated at 12 h after plating in 60-mm dishes. The surviving

1001-1010.qxd 19/8/2010 11:30 Ì ™ÂÏ›‰·1002
cell fraction was determined using colony formation assays.
Three replicate dishes were used per experiment, and two or
more independent experiments were performed for each
survival point. Eight days after X-irradiation, colonies were
fixed with methanol and stained with a 2% Giemsa solution.
Microscopic colonies containing >50 cells were counted as
having arisen from single surviving cells. Points indicate
mean values. Error bars indicate standard deviations.

Analysis of apoptosis. After a 100-nM rapamycin exposure
and/or 6 Gy of radiation exposure, attached and floating cells
were collected with trypsin, fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde
(Nacalai Tesque) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4˚C,
washed with PBS, stained with 0.2 mM Hoechst 33342
(Nacalai Tesque), and then observed under a fluorescence
microscope. Induction of apoptosis was scored by the detection
of nuclear and cytoplasmic condensation and the formation
and release of apoptic bodies. A minimum of 300 cells was
counted in every sample, and the percentage of apoptotic
cells was determined. Values are the means of two independent
experiments. Error bars indicate standard deviations.

Analysis of cell proliferation. Using colony formation assays
as described above, the size of all of the colonies was also
measured for analysis of cell proliferation. Ten days after
X-irradiation, colonies were fixed with methanol and stained
with a 2% Giemsa solution. Photographs of the colonies
were taken under a microscope (Olympus BX51, Olympus
Optical, Tokyo, Japan). The diameter of each colony was
measured from scanning profiles using a Windows computer
with the Scion image program (Scion Co., Frederick, MD).
The area of each colony (Ax) in mm2 was calculated from the
diameter of the colony. On the basis of the mean value of
the colony area, Am, for each cell line control treated with
DMSO only, colonies were sorted into three groups as
follows; Ax ≤ 1/2xAm, where Ax was defined as a small-sized
colony; 1/2xAm < Ax ≤ Am, where Ax was defined as a
medium-sized colony; Am < Ax was defined as a large-sized
colony. The number of colonies in each colony group classification
was determined and calculated as a percentage of the
entire colony population. Values are the means of at least two
independent experiments. Error bars indicate standard
deviations.

Cell cycle analysis. Cell cycle distributions were assayed by
determining DNA content. After treatment with 100 nM
rapamycin and/or 9 Gy of radiation, cells were fixed with
cold 70% methanol and stored at 4˚C for 24 h before analysis.
For cell cycle analysis, the cells were incubated for 30 min at
room temperature with 1 mg/ml RNase and 50 μg/ml propidium
iodide (PI). Before flow cytometric analysis, samples
were filtered through a 35-μm nylon mesh. Samples were
analyzed using a flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, San
Jose, CA). Three independent experiments were performed
for each data point. Values are the means of three independent
experiments. Error bars indicate standard deviations.

Western blot analysis. Cells were treated with rapamycin
alone (100 nM, 1 h), radiation alone (6 Gy), or a combination
in individual experiments. After X-irradiation, the medium

was replaced with fresh medium. At indicated time points,
cells were harvested and then washed with ice-cold PBS
twice. Cells were suspended in RIPA buffer (50 mM TrisHCl,
pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate,
0.05% SDS). Whole cell protein lysates were then
subjected to freezing and thawing three times. The protein
levels in the whole cell protein lysate supernatants obtained
after centrifugation (15,000 rpm x 10 min) were quantified
with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Labs, Richmond,
CA). Aliquots containing 20 μg of protein were electrophoresed
through 7, 10, or 15% polyacrylamide gels containing
0.1% SDS. The separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically
onto Poly Screen PVDF membranes (Dupont/
Biotechnology Systems, NEN Research Products, Boston,
MA). Membranes were blocked with 1% (w/v) non-fat dry
milk in PBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes
were then incubated overnight at 4˚C with primary antibodies.
Rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-mTOR (Ser2448), antiphospho-Akt
(Ser473) antibodies, and rabbit monoclonal antiphospho-S6
(Ser240/244) antibodies were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Mouse monoclonal
anti-cyclin D1 (Ab-3), and anti-p21WAF1 (Ab-1) antibodies
were acquired from Oncogene Sciences, Inc. (Uniondale,
NY) and Calbiochem (San Diego, CA), respectively. Goat
polyclonal anti-actin antibody (I-19) was obtained from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Appropriate
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
[anti-mouse IgG antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San
Francisco, CA), anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., Piscataway, NJ)] were incubated for
1 h at room temperature. For visualization of the bands, an
enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham,
Piscataway, NJ) was used according to the manufacturer's
protocol. The amounts of the proteins in the samples were
quantified by scanning profiles using the Scion imaging
program.

Statistical analysis. Significance levels were calculated using
the Student's t-test. Values of P<0.05 were considered statistically
significant.

Results

Effect of rapamycin on radiation sensitivity. To clarify the
effect of rapamycin on radiation sensitivity in H1299 cells
with a wtp53 or mp53 gene, cell survival was estimated with
colony formation assays. The inhibitory effect of rapamycin
alone on cell survival was not striking at concentrations
ranging from 0.01 to 1,000 nM in either cell line (data not
shown). Using a non-toxic concentration of the drug, cells
were treated with or without 100 nM rapamycin for 1 h
and/or 0-9 Gy of radiation. Previously, it was shown that 1 h
provides sufficient time for mTOR inhibition to be induced
without significant cytotoxicity (35). In agreement with a
previous report (36), H1299/mp53 cells were more resistant
to radiation than H1299/wtp53 cells (Fig. 1). In the presence
of 100 nM rapamycin, decreased cell survival levels were
observed in a dose-dependent manner in both cell lines. At a
dose of 6 Gy, there was a statistically significant difference
in the inhibition of cell survival between the combined

treatment and radiation alone. These results showed that the
cytotoxic effect of radiation is synergistically enhanced by
rapamycin, independently of cellular p53 gene status.

Effect of rapamycin on radiation-induced apoptosis. To
examine whether the cytotoxic effect of rapamycin depends
on the induction of apoptosis, H1299 cells were analyzed at
48 h after X-irradiation with or without 100 nM rapamycin,

using Hoechst 33342 staining. As shown in Fig. 2, a single
treatment with rapamycin did not alter the proportion of
apoptotic cells when compared to controls in either H1299-
derived cell line. Radiation-induced apoptosis to a significant
extent, and the proportion of apoptotic cells in H1299/wtp53
cells was almost three times as high as in H1299/mp53 cells
(8.0% in H1299/wtp53 cells and 2.6% in H1299/mp53 cells).
Moreover, in the presence of rapamycin, the incidence of
radiation-induced apoptosis was increased 1.6-fold in the
wild-type cells and 2.2-fold in the mutated cells. These results
indicated that the combined treatment promotes radiationinduced
apoptosis regardless of p53 gene status.

Effect of rapamycin on cell proliferation. To investigate the
effect of rapamycin on cell proliferation in H1299 cells
containing differing p53 gene status, colony formation assays
were used. Cells were treated with or without 100 nM rapamycin
for 1 h and/or 6 Gy of radiation. The area of each
resulting cell colony was measured and colonies were classified
into three groups; small, medium and large-sized colonies.
As shown in Fig. 3, the number of each group of colonies
was calculated as a percentage of the entire population of
colonies. For H1299/wtp53 cells, each single treatment
increased the proportion of small colonies (55.5% for rapamycin
alone and 80.7% for radiation alone, versus 20.3% for
controls). For H1299/mp53, the cytostatic effect of each
single treatment was similar (57.6% for rapamycin alone
and 80.1% for radiation alone, versus 29.0% for controls,
respectively). Moreover, the combined treatment produced a
greater cytostatic effect than either single treatment did
in both of the cell lines (H1299/wtp53, 97.4% and H1299/
mp53, 91.7%, respectively). These results showed that the
combined treatment results in an augmented cytostatic effect
of radiation in a p53-independent manner.

Effect of rapamycin combined with radiation on the cell
cycle. To explore the effect of radiosensitization by rapamycin

on the cell cycle in H1299 cells, the proportion of cells in
each phase of the cell cycle was analyzed with flow cytometry
using propidium iodide staining. In addition, the
question of whether the cell cycle response to the combined
treatment was altered by p53 gene status was examined. At
12 h after a 100-nM rapamycin exposure, there was a slight
increase in G1 phase cells in both cell lines, whereas following
9 Gy of radiation there was a transient arrest in G2/M phase
even in the presence of 100 nM rapamycin (data not shown).
At 24 h, rapamycin showed larger effects on the cell cycle

distribution, whereas there was no significant difference in
the cell cycle distribution in cells treated with radiation alone
or in controls in both H1299 cell lines (Fig. 4). A significant
accumulation of cells in G1 phase was induced by rapamycin
(67% in H1299/wtp53 cells versus 46.1% for radiation alone,
and 56.9% for control cells, 54.1% in H1299/mp53 cells
versus 45.3% for radiation alone, and 49.7% in controls,
respectively). Furthermore, a marked decrease in S phase
cells was observed in H1299/wtp53 cells after exposure to
rapamycin (13.0% versus 28.4% for radiation alone, and 28.4%

for controls, respectively). In particular, regardless of p53
gene status, the combined treatment showed a greater increase
in G1 arrest (78.1% in H1299/wtp53 cells, and 61.9% in
H1299/mp53 cells), and a reduction of S phase cells (3.6% in
H1299/wtp53 cells, and 6.5% in H1299/mp53 cells versus
24.7% for rapamycin alone, 20.8% for radiation alone and
27.0% for controls, respectively).

Radiation-induced Akt/mTOR signal. To investigate dynamic
molecular changes in the Akt/mTOR signal in response to
radiation, the activation states of Akt and mTOR were first
examined in the two H1299 cell lines. Secondly, to evaluate
whether radiation activates the Akt/mTOR signal in H1299
cells, Western blotting was used to examine the time course
of alterations in the expression levels of phospho-Akt (Ser473),
p-mTOR (Ser2448) and p-S6 (Ser240/244) ribosomal protein,

which is a downstream effector of mTOR action. Cells were
irradiated with 6 Gy of radiation in medium containing 10%
serum. In both H1299 cell lines, Akt and mTOR were both
phosphorylated, indicating the constitutive activation of the
Akt/mTOR signal pathway (Fig. 5). After X-irradiation, the
phosphorylation level in both of these proteins was increased
in both H1299 cell lines. The p-Akt (Ser473) levels increased
soon after X-irradiation, and this increase was sustained for
up to 1 h in H1299/wtp53 cells and 2 h in H1299/mp53 cells. In
both H1299 cell lines, the increase of p-mTOR (Ser2448) was
evident at 1 h after X-irradiation. The elevated level of pmTOR
(Ser2448) in the p53-mutated cells was higher than in the
wild-type p53 cells. The levels of p-mTOR (Ser2448) remained
elevated up to 6 h after X-irradiation in both cell lines. A
delayed increase in p-S6 (Ser240/244) levels was observed at
3 h after X-irradiation in both cell lines. The level of p-S6

p-S6 (Ser240/244) were estimated with Western blotting. Equal protein loading was confirmed by blotting for actin (42 kDa) protein.

were extracted. Expression of phospho-Akt (Ser473), p-mTOR (Ser2448), p-S6 (Ser240/244), relative to actin (loading control) was determined with Western
blotting.

1001-1010.qxd 19/8/2010 11:30 Ì ™ÂÏ›‰·1006
(Ser240/244) in both H1299 cell lines still remained high up to
12 h after X-irradiation (data not shown). The level of the
Akt/mTOR signal in H1299/mp53 cells was higher than in
H1299/wtp53 cells. From this finding, it would appear that
H1299 cells with elevated Akt/mTOR activity are good candidates
for mTOR inhibition combined with radiation.

Inhibition of the mTOR signal by rapamycin. To investigate
the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of mTOR
inhibition on the Akt/mTOR pathway, cells were treated
with or without 100 nM rapamycin for 1 h and/or 6 Gy of
radiation. The changes in the phosphorylation status of Akt
(Ser473), mTOR (Ser2448) and S6 (Ser240/244) were estimated. At
3 h after exposure to rapamycin, significant decrease in p-S6
(Ser240/244) was observed in H1299/wtp53 and in H1299/
mp53 cells (Fig. 6), and this decrease persisted for 12 h (data
not shown). In particular, the level of this protein was much
lower than its basal level, and the levels of p-Akt (Ser473)
and p-mTOR (Ser2448) were attenuated in the wild-type
cells. Furthermore, despite activation of the Akt/mTOR
signal induced by radiation, the combined treatment led to a
dramatic suppression of p-mTOR (Ser2448) and p-S6 (Ser240/244)
p53 independently. As seen after a single treatment with
rapamycin, the level of p-S6 (Ser240/244) was much lower than
its basal level in both types of cells. The combined treatment
also resulted in a small decrease in p-Akt (Ser473) in
H1299/wtp53 cells, whereas there was no difference in p-Akt
(Ser473) levels in H1299/mp53 cells. In addition, the expression
of the pro-survival molecules cyclin D1 and p21WAF1
were analyzed. At 6 h after a single treatment with rapamycin,
repression of cyclin D1 was detected only in the wild-type
cells (Fig. 7). At the same time point, regardless of p53 gene
status, significant down-regulation of cyclin D1 was detected
after the combined treatment. Induction of p21WAF1 was
apparent following X-irradiation in H1299/wtp53 cells and
rapamycin repressed p21WAF1 expression through blockade
of mTOR. However, no significant induction of p21WAF1
was detected in H1299/mp53 cells after any treatment, confirming
an impaired p53/p21WAF1 signal pathway.

Discussion

It was observed that the Akt/mTOR signal is constitutively
activated in H1299 cells harboring either a wtp53 or mp53 gene
(Fig. 5). It was also seen that dynamic molecular changes in
the Akt/mTOR signal in response to X-irradiation occurred
in H1299 cells, regardless of p53 gene status. Radiation
activated Akt, stimulating downstream signal transduction
molecules such as mTOR and S6. However, rapamycin at a
non-toxic concentration (100 nM) caused a pronounced p53-
independent down-regulation of p-S6 (Ser240/244) and cyclin
D1 after the combined treatment (Figs. 6 and 7). The sensitivity
of cancer cells to radiation-induced cytotoxicity depends
on the balance between pro-survival and pro-apoptotic signals.
Therefore, the effective induction of apoptosis by a specific
blockade of pro-survival signals can be a significant event
leading to radiosensitization. It was found that rapamycin
sensitizes both types of H1299 cells (containing either wtp53
or mp53) to radiation by promoting apoptosis, whereas a
single treatment of rapamycin did not induce apoptosis in
either H1299 cell line (Fig. 2). In comparison to H1299/
mp53 cells, a 3-fold higher incidence of apoptosis was seen
in H1299/wtp53 cells after the combined treatment. This
result suggests that rapamycin can enhance radiation-induced
apoptosis through a p53-dependent pathway. Although in
the presence of rapamycin, there was still a small increase
in radiation-induced apoptosis in mp53 cells, this result
indicates that the combined treatment may promote radiationinduced
apoptosis in a p53-independent manner by downregulation
of pro-survival signals. It has been shown that Akt
deactivation acts as a causal mediator of cell death in several
types of cancer cells in response to diverse stimuli including
DNA-damaging agents and UV-B irradiation (37). In particular,
Akt activation is closely associated with the upregulation
of mTOR in NSCLC (14). Therefore, in this study,
mTOR inhibition by rapamycin combined with radiation
might reduce the level of the Akt/mTOR pro-survival signal
below a threshold level which maintains cell survival. If so,
an apoptotic signal may be promoted in both cell lines. The

p53-independent enhanced cytotoxicity of radiation produced
by rapamycin was confirmed by colony formation assays
(Fig. 1). The cytotoxic effect of radiation was synergistically
enhanced by rapamycin at a non-toxic concentration regardless
of cellular p53 gene status.
A single treatment of rapamycin suppressed cell proliferation
in both cell lines (Fig. 3). In particular, observations of
cell cycle distributions with flow cytometric analysis provide
additional evidence of the cytostatic effect of rapamycin on
H1299 cells. At 24 h after exposure, a single treatment
with rapamycin (100 nM) mediated a slight increase in the
proportion of G1 phase in cells containing wtp53 (10%) and it
led to a remarkable reduction in S phase cells (15%) (Fig. 4).
In H1299/mp53 cells, a small increase in G1 arrest (5%) was
induced by rapamycin alone, along with a less pronounced
decrease in S phase cells. In agreement with previous reports
(38,39), these findings indicate that a G1 cell cycle arrest or a
suppression of progression to S phase may contribute to
the cytostatic effect of rapamycin observed in H1299 cells.
These results were associated with the down-regulation of
cyclin D1 in wtp53 cells (Fig. 7). However, the proportion of
S phase cells in cells containing mp53 was unaffected by
rapamycin which was consistent with no change in cyclin D1
expression. In agreement with a previous study using rhabdomyosarcoma
cells with an mp53 gene (40), these results
suggest that rapamycin does not stop the cell cycle, but may
retard progression of the cell cycle in H1299/mp53 cells. Cell
cycle regulation in tumor cells is important in order to
account for the radiosensitizing effect of this drug. At 12 h
after radiation with or without rapamycin, a remarkable cell
cycle arrest at G2/M was induced when compared with control
cells (data not shown). After 24 h, no G2/M delay was seen in
cells treated with radiation alone, showing no significant
difference in cell cycle distributions when compared with
controls (Fig. 4). However, at the same time point, rapamycin
showed promising effects on the cell cycle distribution when
compared with control cells and radiation alone. Regardless
of p53 gene status, the combination of radiation and rapamycin
caused a significant increase in G1 arrest and a remarkable
inhibition of progression to S phase. This result corresponded
with the observed decrease in cell proliferation seen with the
colony formation assay, and the repression of the mTOR
signal and cyclin D1 expression seen with Western blotting
(Fig. 7). The activation of mTOR can increase the proliferation
rate through the increased translation of cell cycle
effectors such as cyclin D1 (41). In thyroid cancer cells,
RAD001 treatment reduced cyclin D1 and cyclin D3 protein
levels, confirming that mTOR activation contributes to cell
proliferation (42). Therefore, these results demonstrated that
rapamycin might enhance the cytostatic effect of radiation
due to cell cycle arrest. However, it has been demonstrated
that growth-arrested cells can be relatively radioresistant
when compared to actively cycling cells (43). In glioma
spheroid cells, it has been shown that despite the induction
of G1 arrest and the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation,
rapamycin does not diminish the efficacy of radiation. Another
study has shown that an increase in the frequency of G2/M
cell cycle arrest was seen in breast cancer cells treated with
rapamycin and radiation, suggesting that cell cycle arrest
may have been a contributing factor in the increased radiosensitization
(26). In the data shown here, a time-dependent
effect on the cell cycle was seen in both cell lines after a
combined treatment although there could conceivably be an
alteration in the effect of these treatments in asynchronously
growing cell populations. However, the actual response to a
treatment may depend on the cellular context, including the
cell cycle, even in asynchronous cell populations. Thus, the
mechanism underlying the radiosensitization by rapamycin
described in this study may be reasonable.
In response to radiation, the p53 protein is stabilized and
can both initiate and suppress gene expression. The transactivation
of p53-target genes mediates apoptosis and cell cycle
arrest (2,27,44). p53-dependent cell cycle arrest is primarily
mediated by the CDK (cyclin-dependent kinase) inhibitor
p21WAF1. p21WAF1 acts as a crucial regulator of the cell cycle
checkpoint during the G1 transition, and enables the potential
for DNA damage repair (45). In addition to being an inhibitor
of cell proliferation, p21WAF1 plays a role as an inhibitor of
apoptosis. High levels of p21WAF1 expression protect damaged
cells from p53-dependent apoptosis. Some previous studies
suggested that RAD001 sensitizes cancer cells with wild-type
p53 to cisplatin by blocking p53-induced p21WAF1 expression
through the inhibition of mTOR, and enhances cisplatininduced
apoptosis in human lung cancer and HCC (17,33).
Treatment with p21 antisense resulted in enhanced radiation
sensitivity by converting growth arrest to apoptosis in colon
cancer cells (46). Consistent with these previous reports,
Western blotting here showed that rapamycin strongly inhibits
p53-induced p21WAF1 expression following X-irradiation and
results in induction of apoptosis in H1299 cells with a wtp53
(Figs. 2 and 7). These findings suggest that rapamycin leads
to radiosensitization in a p53-dependent manner through the
suppression of p21WAF1. Although H1299/mp53 cells lack the
ability to induce expression of p21WAF1 after X-irradiation,
radiation-induced apoptosis was promoted following the
combined treatment regardless of p53 gene status (Fig. 2). In
human HCC with a mutated p53 gene, RAD001 enhanced
cisplatin-induced apoptosis through the down-regulation of
pro-survival molecules such as Bcl-2, survivin and cyclin
D1, suggesting that rapamycin could lower the apoptotic
threshold (33). In this study, the combined treatment led to a
decrease in cyclin D1 expression and increased the incidence
of apoptosis in mp53 cells (Figs. 2 and 7). There is a possible
explanation for these results. The sensitivity of cancer cells
to radiation-induced apoptosis depends on the balance
between pro-survival and pro-apoptotic signals. It appears
that the p53-independent signaling pathway leading to the
induction of apoptosis might be dominant over the prosurvival
signals in the presence of a blockade of the Akt/
mTOR signal, and result in an induction of apoptosis in
H1299 cells with mp53.
In conclusion, this study indicates that rapamycin may
enhance radiation sensitivity in a p53-dependent and in a
p53-independent manner. The sensitivity of cancer cells to
radiation-induced apoptosis may involve the depression of
pro-survival signals. Both, the loss of p53-pathway functions
and radiation-induced up-regulation of the mTOR signal are
responsible for radiation resistance. Therefore, inhibition of
the mTOR signal may be a promising strategy to enhance the
effect of radiation regardless of p53 gene status through the

down-regulation of pro-survival signals and a reduction in
the apoptotic threshold. Since these results suggest that
rapamycin can enhance radiation therapy, not only in wtp53
cancer patients but also in mp53 cancer patients, through the
two aspects of cell lethality and cell growth depression, it
may be possible to hope for a high efficacy in treatments
against human lung cancer with a suitable application of
these agents.
