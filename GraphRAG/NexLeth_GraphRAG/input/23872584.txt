Abstract
The occurrence of inactivating mutations in SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling genes in common cancers has
attracted a great deal of interest. However, mechanistic strategies to target tumor cells carrying such mutations
are yet to be developed. This study proposes a synthetic-lethality therapy for treating cancers deficient in the SWI/
SNF catalytic (ATPase) subunit, BRG1/SMARCA4. The strategy relies upon inhibition of BRM/SMARCA2, another
catalytic SWI/SNF subunit with a BRG1-related activity. Immunohistochemical analysis of a cohort of non–smallcell
lung carcinomas (NSCLC) indicated that 15.5% (16 of 103) of the cohort, corresponding to preferentially
undifferentiated tumors, was deficient in BRG1 expression. All BRG1-deficient cases were negative for alterations
in known therapeutic target genes, for example, EGFR andDDR2 gene mutations, ALK gene fusions, or FGFR1 gene
amplifications. RNA interference (RNAi)–mediated silencing of BRM suppressed the growth of BRG1-deficient
cancer cells relative to BRG1-proficient cancer cells, inducing senescence via activation of p21/CDKN1A. This
growth suppression was reversed by transduction of wild-type but not ATPase-deficient BRG1. In support of these
in vitro results, a conditional RNAi study conducted in vivo revealed that BRM depletion suppressed the growth of
BRG1-deficient tumor xenografts. Our results offer a rationale to develop BRM-ATPase inhibitors as a strategy to
treat BRG1/SMARCA4–deficient cancers, including NSCLCs that lack mutations in presently known therapeutic
target genes. Cancer Res; 73(17); 5508–18. 2013 AACR.

Introduction

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are effective against solid tumors
with activating mutations in tyrosine kinase genes, for example,
the EGFR mutations and ALK fusions harbored by lung
adenocarcinomas (1). We and others recently identified RET
oncogene fusions in lung adenocarcinoma (2–4), supporting
the importance of tyrosine kinase genes as therapeutic targets.
Two other tyrosine kinase gene alterations, the FGFR1 amplification
and the DDR2 mutation, have been identified as
therapeutic targets in squamous cell carcinoma, which corresponds
to another major type of non–small-cell lung carcinoma
(NSCLC; refs. 5, 6). Meanwhile, inactivating somatic mutations
of genes that encode subunits of the SWI/SNF chromatinremodeling
complex, such as BRG1/SMARCA4, PBRM1/
BAF180, ARID1A/BAF250A, and ARID2/BAF200, have attracted
much interest as they were first identified by genome-wide
sequencing analyses of cancer cells (7). Such mutations are
thought to interfere with the functions of the SWI/SNF complex
in transcription (7) and DNA double-strand break repair
(8), which are likely to be critical for cancer development and/
or progression. However, no therapeutic strategies have yet
been developed for specifically targeting cancer cells harboring
these inactivating SWI/SNF mutations.
Synthetic-lethality therapy holds great promise. The BRCA1
and BRCA2 genes have a synthetic-lethal relationship with the
PARP1 gene; the growth of BRCA1- or BRCA2-deficient cancer
cells is dependent on PARP1 function. These findings have
been translated to the clinic through the development of PARP
inhibitors to treat BRCA1/BRCA2–deficient tumors (9). Synthetic-lethality
therapy has also been proposed for treatment
of cancers deficient in genes involved in DNA mismatch repair
and cell metabolism (10–12). Here, we developed a novel
synthetic-lethality strategy for killing tumor cells deficient in
the SWI/SNF subunit BRG1 (also known as SMARCA4). Indeed,
inactivating somatic BRG1 mutations are present in several
cancers, as reported by our group and others (13–15). Many
lung cancers (10%–30%) exhibit reduced or absent expression

of the BRG1 protein due to somatic truncating mutations in the
BRG1 gene or unspecified epigenetic alterations (13, 15–18).
Furthermore, BRG1 was recently identified as one of the most
frequently mutated genes in medulloblastoma (19, 20) and
Burkitt lymphoma (21).
Each SWI/SNF complex contains either BRG1 or BRM
(also known as SMARCA2) as its catalytic (ATPase) subunit
(7, 22). BRG1 and BRM play complementary roles, as indicated
by the observation that Brm-deficient mice develop
normally but exhibit upregulated BRG1 expression in somatic
cells (23). Brg1-null heterozygous mice spontaneously
develop mammary tumors, and specific alleles of BRG1 are
associated with cancer predisposition in humans (24).
Therefore, BRG1/Brg1 acts as a tumor-suppressor gene
(25). The complementary roles of BRG1 and BRM, coupled
with the involvement of the SWI/SNF complex in multiple
critical cellular functions, suggest that BRG1 and BRM might
have a synthetic-lethal relationship; therefore, we examined
the ability of BRM inhibition to specifically kill BRG1-deficient
tumor cells. In addition, to address the potential
significance of BRM-inhibitory therapies, we examined the
characteristics of BRG1-deficient NSCLCs, including the
mutually exclusive relationship between BRG1 deficiencies
and mutations in therapeutic target genes (EGFR and DDR2
mutations, ALK fusions, and FGFR1 amplifications; Fig. 1A).

Materials and Methods

NSCLC cohort
Surgical specimens from 103 patients with NSCLC (51
adenocarcinomas and 53 squamous cell carcinomas), who
received surgical resection at the National Cancer Center
Hospital (Tokyo, Japan), between 1997 and 2007, were analyzed
(Table 1 and Supplementary Materials and Methods). The
study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the
National Cancer Center (Tokyo, Japan).

Immunohistochemical analysis of BRG1 and BRM
Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted on tissue
microarray sections obtained from anonymized NSCLC samples.
The methods used for immunohistochemical staining and
the criteria for BRG1 and BRM positivity are described in the
Supplementary Materials and Methods. Specific staining for
BRG1 and BRM was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of
cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Examination of driver gene mutations
Genomic DNA obtained from tumor tissues was analyzed for
somatic mutations in the EGFR and KRAS genes using the highresolution
melting method (26). Mutations in all DDR2 coding
regions in squamous cell lung carcinoma samples were examined
by targeted genome capture and massively parallel
sequencing using an Ion PGM sequencing system (Life Technologies)
and the HaloPlex Target Enrichment System (Agilent
Technologies). EML4-ALK and KIF5B-ALK fusions were
screened by immunohistochemistry using an anti-ALK antibody
(Abcam; 5A4), followed by confirmation via reverse-transcriptase
PCR (RT-PCR) and/or fluorescence/chromogenic in situ
hybridization (27). RET and ROS1 fusions (in cases for which

RNA samples are available) were examined by RT-PCR (2, 4).
FGFR1 amplification was examined by conducting FISH analysis
(28) on 69 NSCLC samples that were available for analysis
(Supplementary Materials and Methods).

Cell lines
A427, A549, H157, H460, H520, H522, H661, H1299, H1703,
H1819, LK2, HCC515, II-18 (NSCLC), U2OS (osteosarcoma),
HT1080 (fibrosarcoma), HeLa (cervical cancer), WiDr, HCT116
(colorectal cancer), HFL-1, and MRC-5 (fibroblast) cells were
cultured in RPMI-1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS.
293FT cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS. A549, H1819, H661,
H157, H1299, A427, H522, and H1703 are lung cancer cell lines
harboring truncating BRG1 mutations, whereas H520, HeLa,
LK2, H460, U2OS, and HT1080 carry wild-type BRG1 (13, 17).
The BRG1 mutation status of all the cell lines used in this study
is given in Supplementary Table S1. Alterations in BRG1 and
other cancer-related genes were verified in the cell lines we
examined; some of the results were previously reported (Supplementary
Table S2; ref. 17).
Mutations in BRG1- and BRM-coding regions in HCC515
and II-18 cells, which do not express BRG1, and 16 primary
tumors negative for BRG staining were examined by targeted
genome capture and massively parallel sequencing of genomic
DNA using an Ion PGM sequencing system and the Ion
TargetSeq Custom Enrichment Kit (Life Technologies).
Mutations detected were verified by Sanger sequencing of
genomic PCR products. The effect of single-nucleotide variants
resulting in amino acid changes in the BRG1 ATPase
domain, expressed in HCT116 (L1163P) and WiDr (D1284N)
colorectal cancer cells (16), was estimated using the PolyPhen
and PolyPhen-2 programs. The substitutions in
HCT116 cells are thought to abrogate ATPase activity, but
those in WiDr cells are benign (Supplementary Table S3).

siRNA
ON-TARGET plus SMARTpool siRNA (Dharmacon) was
used in this study. To knockdown the BRM protein, cells
were transfected with siBRM (cat. no: 6597: SMARCA4) using
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). Nontargeting siRNA
(L-001810-10) was used as a negative control.

Establishment of cells expressing doxycycline-inducible
short hairpin BRM
To achieve doxycycline-inducible knockdown of BRM, a
lentiviral vector–based short hairpin RNA (shRNA)–mediated
conditional gene-expression system [established by Wiznerowicz
and Trono (29)] was used (Supplementary Materials and
Methods). H1299 cells carrying a shRNA targeting BRM (H1299-
shBRM) or shRNA targeting the GFP gene (H1299-shControl)
were established. HeLa-shBRM and HeLa-shControl cells were
established in the same manner.

Immunoblot analysis
Immunoblotting was conducted as previously described (8).
The antibodies used in the present study are listed in the
Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Cell survival assay
The effect of BRM knockdown on the survival of BRG1-
deficient (undetectable by immunoblot analysis) and BRG1-
proficient (detectable by immunoblot analysis) cancer cells
was evaluated using clonogenic survival assays. Because noncancerous
fibroblasts do not form colonies on culture plates,
the viability of these cells was determined by examining
cellular ATP levels using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell
Viability Assay Kit (Promega). The detailed procedures for
these assays were described in the Supplementary Materials
and Methods.

Complementation assay
The complementary role of BRG1 was examined in BRMdepleted
cancer cells by transfecting cDNAs encoding wildtype
and mutant BRG1 (BRG1K785A, which disrupts the ATPbinding
pocket in BRG1; ref. 30) into BRG1-null H1299 cells
(Supplementary Materials and Methods).

Cell-cycle analysis
Cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, washed in PBS, and fixed
in ice-cold 70% ethanol. The cells were then centrifuged
again, incubated with PBS containing 200 mg/mL RNase A and

The staining intensity of BRG1 and BRM antibodies in the tumor cell nuclei in each lung cancer sample was scored according to Fukuoka and
colleagues (46): 0, no signal; 1, weak; 2, moderate; and 3, strong; comparable with that in salivary gland cells used as the positive control; in addition,
the intratumoral fractions of regions with each score (0–3) were determined. The total score for each lung cancer tissue (the sum of the intensity scores
and the fractions) was compared with that of noncancerous lung tissues (n ¼ 6). A tumor sample was judged positive (þ) or negative/weak ()
when
the total score was higher or lower, respectively, than the average total score of the normal lung epithelial tissues. C, representative images of

Senescence-associated b-galactosidase (SA-b-gal) staining
was conducted using the Senescence b-Galactosidase Staining
Kit (Cell Signaling Technology). The percentage of SA-b-gal–

doxycycline, and then cultured. The cells were trypsinized and
counted every 3 days, and after each count, 1  105 cells were
reseeded in new dishes with fresh medium. Accumulated cell
numbers were calculated at each passage, based on the total
number of cells and the dilution ratio at the time of passage.
The experiment was carried out in duplicate.

Mouse xenograft model
The effect of BRM ablation on the growth of H1299-shBRM
and H1299-shControl tumor xenografts was examined in
BALB/c-nu/nu mice (Supplementary Materials and Methods).
All experiments were approved by the Ethical Committee on
Animal Experiments at the National Cancer Center.

Statistical analysis
Logistic regression analysis was conducted using JMP (ver
5.1). Fisher exact test and Student t test were conducted using
StatMate III (ver 3.17). P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Experiments were carried out in triplicate unless
otherwise stated.
Results
Characteristics of BRG1-deficient NSCLCs
We first examined the characteristics of BRG1-deficient
NSCLCs. Because BRG1 has been reported to play a role in
cell differentiation (31), the examined cases were selected to
include similar numbers of adenocarcinomas and squamous
cell carcinomas of the three differentiation grades (well, moderately,
and poorly differentiated; Table 1). This approach
allowed an efficient analysis of the association between BRG1
expression and tumor differentiation. Immunohistochemical
analysis revealed that BRG1 protein expression was either low
or absent in 16 of 103 (15.5%) NSCLCs (Fig. 1B and C). Low or
absent BRG1 expression was more prevalent in poorly differentiated
tumors (Table 1 and Fig. 1D), and was also prevalent in
males and smokers. Mutational analysis of BRG1 and BRM in 16
cases negative for BRG1 staining revealed that 1 case had
nonsense BRG1 mutations (Supplementary Fig. S2), whereas
the remaining 15 did not, implying that both genetic alterations
and epigenetic silencing of the BRG1 gene can cause
BRG1 deficiency, as previously reported (18). On the other
hand, deleterious BRM mutations were not detected in these 16
cases including 5 that were negative for BRM staining.

Driver gene mutations in BRG1-deficient NSCLCs
Next, we analyzed representative therapeutically relevant
gene mutations (EGFR and KRAS gene mutations and ALK
fusions) in the 103 NSCLC cases. The 16 BRG1-deficient cases
were negative for mutations in all three driver genes, including
the two therapeutic targets (EGFR mutation and ALK
fusion; Fig. 1D, Table 1). We also analyzed other driver gene
mutations, RET and ROS1 fusions (2–4), in the 9 BRG1-deficient
cases for which tumor tissue RNA was available, but we
detected no fusions. Recent whole-genome analyses have also
suggested that BRG1 mutations are prevalent in tumors without
EGFR mutations or ALK fusions (Supplementary Table S4;
refs. 32, 33). In addition, all the BRG1-deficient cases were also
negative for two other alterations, FGFR1 amplifications and

DDR2 mutations (Fig. 1D; Table 1; Supplementary Fig. S3;
refs. 5, 6). These findings suggest that most BRG1-deficient
NSCLCs are not suitable for current molecularly targeted
therapies based on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (1). Of the 16
BRG1-deficient cases, 10 (62.5%, 9.7% of all cases studied)
expressed BRM.

BRM-dependent growth of BRG1-deficient cancer cells
We then compared the effect of siRNA-mediated BRM
ablation on in vitro growth of BRG1-deficient (n ¼ 10) and
BRG1-proficient (n ¼ 8) cancer cell lines, using a clonogenic
survival assay (Fig. 2A). Most (8 of 10) BRG1-deficient cells carry
truncating BRG1 mutations/deletions (Supplementary Table
S2; refs. 13, 17). Of the remaining two BRG1-deficient cell lines,
we detected a homozygous nonsense mutation in one
(HCC515) by targeted genome capture sequencing (Supplementary
Fig. S2), but no BRG1 mutation in the other (II-18). On
the other hand, BRG1-proficient cancer cells did not harbor
such deleterious BRG1 mutations (except HCT116 cells, which
harbor a heterozygous missense mutation that is likely to
disrupt the BRG1 ATPase domain; ref. 15).
We observed suppression of colony formation in all BRG1-
deficient cells tested, but not in BRG1-proficient lines other
than HCT116 (Fig. 2B and C). The mean values of the surviving
fraction of cancer cell lines are summarized according to the
BRG1 and BRM expression status in Fig. 2D. Survival of BRG1-
deficient cells upon BRM knockdown was significantly lower
than that of BRG1-proficient lines (P ¼ 6.3  106
by Student t
test). The BRM protein was undetectable, or detectable only at
trace levels, in three BRG1-deficient cell lines, A427, H522, and
H1703 (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S4A). These findings are
consistent with a report showing that a fraction of lung cancer
cells lack, or express at low levels, both BRG1 and BRM (Fig. 1B;
ref. 14). Conceivably, the effect of siRNA-mediated BRM knockdown
in these three cell lines was less evident than in the other
seven. Thus, among BRG1-deficient cell lines, the suppression
of colony formation by BRM knockdown was more prominent
in cell lines that originally expressed the BRM protein (P ¼ 4.5
 109
by Student t test; Fig. 2D).
BRM knockdown did not affect the growth of the noncancerous
fibroblast cell lines HFL-1 and MRC-5, which express
both BRG1 and BRM (Fig. 3A and B). Wild-type BRG1 cDNA
complemented the sensitivity of BRG1-deficient H1299 cells to
BRM siRNA-mediated growth inhibition (Fig. 3C and D),
whereas cDNA of an ATPase mutant with a disrupted ATPbinding
pocket, BRG1K785A (30), did not (BRG1K785A is indicated
as KA in Fig. 3C and D). These results indicated that BRG1-
deficient cancer cells depend on BRM for growth, and that this
phenotype is caused by a lack of BRG1 ATPase activity.

BRM depletion induces senescence in BRG1-deficient
cancer cells
To examine the long-term effects of BRM depletion, we
prepared H1299 (BRG1-deficient) and HeLa (BRG1-proficient)
cells expressing either a doxycycline-inducible shRNA targeting
BRM (H1299-shBRM and HeLa-shBRM; refs. 29, 34) or a
nontargeting shRNA (H1299-shControl and HeLa-shControl).
To confirm the effects of BRM knockdown, we used a different

BRM target site from the one used in the siRNA experiments.
The results of the siRNA clonogenic assay were confirmed
using this system (Supplementary Fig. S5). We next examined
the mechanism underlying growth inhibition in H1299-shBRM
cells. Seven days after doxycycline treatment, H1299-shBRM
cells, but not HeLa-shBRM cells, exhibited G1 arrest with an
enlarged and flattened morphology, suggesting senescence
(Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S6). Biomarkers of senescence
(p21/CDKN1A expression, SA-b-gal staining, and SAHF; refs. 35,
36) were observed in doxycycline-treated H1299-shBRM cells,
but not in HeLa-shBRM cells (Fig. 4B and C). Doxycycline
treatment did not affect the proportion of cells in sub-G1-phase

or the number of cells exhibiting distinct nuclear lobation,
indicating that ablation of BRM does not induce apoptosis or
mitotic catastrophe (Fig. 4A and C; ref. 37). Senescence is an
irreversible state of growth arrest that is maintained by p21
(38); therefore, we examined p21 expression in H1299-shBRM
cells in which BRM was reexpressed after doxycycline removal
(Fig. 4D). In these cells, p21 expression was maintained at
the level observed in BRM knockdown cells. Consistent with
this, cells reexpressing BRM exhibited suppressed clonogenic
growth activity. siRNA-mediated knockdown of BRM caused
significant increases in SA-b-gal positivity and the number of
cells in G1-phase in three BRG1-deficient NSCLC cell lines

cell lines. Immunoblot analysis of BRG1-deficient (left) and BRG1-proficient (right) cancer cell lines. Blots of whole-cell extracts were probed with
antibodies against BRG1, BRM, and a-tubulin (a-Tub; loading control). B, survival of BRG1-deficient and -proficient cancer cells after BRM knockdown.
BRG1-deficient (left) and -proficient (right) cells were transfected with BRM-targeting siRNA (siBRM) or nontargeting siRNA (siControl) for 48 hours and then
assayed for colony formation. The surviving fraction of siBRM-treated cells at 10 days was calculated as a ratio (number of colonies formed by siBRM-treated
cells/number of colonies formed by siControl-treated cells). Data are shown as mean  SD. Asterisks show significant differences in surviving fraction
between siBRM- and siControl-treated cells, as determined by Student t test (, P < 0.05;  , P < 0.001). C, BRM protein expression in cancer cells
after siRNA-mediated knockdown. Cells were transfected with siBRM or siControl for 48 hours, harvested, and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Blots of
whole-cell extracts were probed with antibodies against BRM and a-tubulin (loading control). The expression levels of BRM in siBRM-treated cells are
shown relative to those in siControl-treated cells. Knockdown efficiency in A427, H522, and H1703 cells could not be assessed because of their low
endogenous BRM expression levels. D, surviving fraction of cancer cell lines according to BRG1 and BRM expression status. The mean values of the surviving
fractions of each cell line obtained in Fig. 2B are shown. Cell lines are grouped according to deficiency ()
and proficiency (þ) of BRG1 and BRM protein
expression. Significance of differences in the mean values of surviving fraction between BRG1-deficient cell lines and BRG1-proficient cell lines, and BRG1-

Synthetic-Lethality Therapy for BRG1-Deficient Cancer

(H1299, A549, and H157), but not in three BRG1-proficient
NSCLC cell lines (H520, LK2, and H460; Fig 4E–G; Supplementary
Fig. S7). Taken together, these results suggest that BRM
knockdown specifically suppresses the growth of BRG1-deficient
cells by inducing senescence.

BRM-dependent growth of BRG1-deficient cancer cells
in vivo
The number of BRM-depleted H1299-shBRM cells was
approximately 1,000 times lower than that of nondepleted
cells after 4 weeks of culture, whereas the number of HeLashBRM
cells did not change (Fig. 5A). This observation
suggests that inhibition of BRM specifically suppresses the
long-term growth of BRG1-deficient cells (i.e., over at least a
month). To further confirm these data under more physiologically
relevant conditions, we introduced H1299-
shBRM and H1299-shControl cells into an in vivo conditional
RNA interference (RNAi) model (Fig. 5B). BALB/c-nu/

nu mice were injected subcutaneously with H1299-shBRM
or H1299-shControl cells. After 3 weeks, when the injected
cells had formed tumor nodules measuring approximately
100 mm3
, the animals were randomly divided into two
groups and fed a diet containing doxycycline (200 ppm)
or a control diet for 1 month. In doxycycline-fed mice, the
H1299-shBRM xenografts were significantly smaller than
the H1299-shControl xenografts.
Discussion
This study suggests that BRM is a novel therapeutic target
for synthetic-lethality therapy for BRG1-deficient cancers. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first report proposing a
therapeutic strategy that specifically targets and kills cancer
cells harboring inactivating mutations in SWI/SNF chromatinremodeling
genes. In the future, the use of this strategy needs to
be further validated in vivo using multiple lines of BRG1-
deficient and -proficient cancer cells.

Synthetic-Lethality Therapy for BRG1-Deficient Cancer

www.aacrjournals.org Cancer Res; 73(17) September 1, 2013 5515

In our cohort, all the BRG1-deficient tumors were negative
for EGFR mutations and ALK fusions, both of which can be
targeted by existing molecular therapies using tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (1). This negative association of BRG1-
inactivating mutations with therapeutic target mutations
is consistent with two recent genome-wide mutation analyses
of lung adenocarcinoma (Supplementary Table S4;
refs. 32, 33). Indeed, BRG1-deficient NSCLC cell lines are
resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target EGFR
(e.g., A549, H1819, and H1299; ref. 39) or ALK (A549; ref. 40).
Furthermore, those BRG1-deficient tumors were also negative
for FGFR1 amplifications and DDR2 mutations, potential
therapeutic targets recently identified in squamous cell lung
carcinoma (5, 6). These findings highlight the importance of
establishing a treatment strategy for targeting BRG1-deficient
tumors. BRG1 and BRM proteins have ATPase activities
and function as helicases to alter chromatin structure.
ATPases are a druggable target (41); therefore, BRM-targeting
therapy using specific inhibitors is a promising treatment
of lung cancers that are not amenable to existing
molecularly targeted therapies (1). To the best of our knowledge,
specific pharmacologic inhibitors against ATPases
involved in chromatin remodeling have not been developed;
therefore, we are currently seeking to identify substrates that
inhibit BRM-ATPase activity.
The results of this study show that BRG1 and BRM have a
synthetic-lethal relationship. BRG1 functions as a key enzyme
in SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling during transcription, as

well as in DNA double-strand break repair (7, 8, 31). BRG1 is
involved in the expression of genes that regulate cell growth
and stem-cell properties. However, a preliminary study indicated
that the expression of representative genes, including
those encoding E2F1 and cyclin D1, does not differ significantly
between BRG1-proficient and -deficient cells depleted of BRM.
Thus, the mechanisms underlying the synthetic-lethal relationship
between BRG1 and BRM remain unknown. Of concern
is the subset of NSCLC cases (5.8%; Fig. 1B) that lack both BRG1
and BRM expression (14, 22, 42). BRM deficiency is likely to be
due to epigenetic alterations as previously reported (43). The
existence of these cases suggests that a portion of BRG1-
deficient tumors will not respond well to therapies that target
BRM, as suggested by our experiment using cancer cell lines
(Fig. 2B). Such tumors may have acquired the ability to
maintain cell growth through complementation by chromatin-remodeling
proteins other than BRG1 and BRM, although
our preliminary analysis did not reveal complementation by
overexpression of other SWI/SNF and chromatin-remodeling
proteins (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Studies of the molecular
mechanisms underlying the maintenance of cell growth in the
absence of both BRG1 and BRM would be valuable, because it is
possible that BRG1-deficient cells could acquire resistance to
BRM-targeted therapy.
The pathogenic significance of inactivating somatic mutations
in genes encoding the subunits of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling
complex in human cancers is largely
unknown (7). This study sheds light on this issue by showing

that BRG1-deficient tumors are often poorly differentiated.
A previous report showed that BRG1 promotes cell differentiation,
that is, the inactivation of BRG1 enables cancer cells to
maintain undifferentiated gene-expression programs (31).
Therefore, loss of BRG1 function may be responsible for tumor
dedifferentiation. Our results also indicated that BRG1 deficiency
is prevalent in tumors of males and smokers (Table 1),
consistent with recent genome-wide mutational studies (Supplementary
Table S5; refs. 40, 41). Therefore, BRG1 deficiency
may play a role in lung carcinogenesis preferentially in male
and/or smokers, although the underlying mechanisms remain
unclear.
Taken together, the results of this study identify BRM as a
candidate target molecule for synthetic-lethal therapy for
BRG1-deficient lung cancers. Immunohistochemical analyses
revealed that approximately 10% of NSCLCs are BRG1-
deficient and BRM-proficient, and are therefore predicted
to respond to therapies that target BRM. Inactivation of
BRG1 also occurs in other cancers, including pancreatic,
skin, and brain cancers (44). BRG1 was recently identified as
a gene that is frequently mutated in medulloblastomas
(subgroup 3; ref. 45), which lacks known driver gene mutations
(19, 20). Thus, it is possible that therapies targeting
BRM will be suitable for treating a variety of cancers.
Inactivating mutations in chromatin-remodeling genes other
than BRG1, such as PBRM1/BAF180, ARID1A/BAF250A,
and ARID2/BAF200, have been identified in several common
cancers. Synthetic lethality–based therapeutic strategies
targeting tumors harboring these mutations warrant further
study.
