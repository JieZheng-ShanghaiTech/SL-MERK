While small molecule inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositide3-kinase
(PI3K) are expected to impact the development of new
cancer therapy, the tumor types and underlying cellular pathways
determining inhibitor response remain poorly defined. In this
report, we have studied anti-proliferative effects of the PI3K inhibitors
WAY-266176 and WAY-266175 in a panel of histologically
diverse cancer cells. Inactivation of PI3K caused potent growth
suppression in some cells (MDA468, BT549, MDA361, MCF7,
LNCap, PC3MM2) but minimal suppression in others (MDA231,
MDA435, DU145, HCT116, A549), which correlated with a
differential down-regulation of cyclin D1, c-Myc, and induction of
apoptosis. A heightened PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling was linked
to the sensitive phenotype but did not generally predict inhibitor
response. Interestingly, the resistant cells all displayed an elevated
phospho-ERK that remained elevated after serum deprivation. In
HCT116 cells, activation mutations in the PI3K catalytic subunit
PIK3CA and Ki-Ras correlated with a resistant phenotype, which
was partially sensitized by homologous replacement with the
wild-type Ki-Ras but not by deletion of cellular PTEN. Depletion
of Mek1 via siRNA in resistant cells enhanced PI3K inhibitorinduced
growth suppression. Moreover, a profoundly augmented
growth suppression and apoptosis were achieved in resistant cells
by combination treatment with WAY-266176/WAY-266175 and
Mek1 kinase inhibitor CI-1040 or UO126. The combination
therapy efficiently inhibited mitogenic signaling and reduced
expression of cyclin D1 and c-Myc. Our results identify deregulation
of the Ras/Raf/Mek/ERK pathway as a dominant determinant
in cancer cell resistance to PI3K inhibitors and highlight combined
targeting of PI3K and Mek1 as an effective anticancer strategy.

Introduction

The class‑1a PI3‑kinases (PI3K) catalyze the production of lipid
second messenger phosphatidylinositol‑3,4,5‑triphosphate (PIP3),
which is required for activation of a wide range of cellular func‑
tions of growth and survival.1 The serine/threonine kinase AKT and
mTOR are essential mediators of the PI3K signaling pathways. AKT
and mTOR collectively confer dominant survival signal and promote
cell growth via respective downstream substrates that directly partici‑
pate in apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and cellular translation.2‑4
Deregulated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is widely impli‑
cated in human cancer (reviewed in refs. 5–7). These alterations
include the mutational activation of the p110a catalytic subunit
of PI3K (PIK3CA),8‑11 loss of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN,
a PIP3 phosphatase that inhibits the PI3K signaling (reviewed in
refs. 5 and 7), as well as constitutive PI3K expression and/or AKT
activation in numerous cancer types.12‑18 Together, these clinical data
establish a central involvement of the PI3K pathway in tumor growth
and resistance to chemotherapy.
While small molecule inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR path‑
ways are expected to impact the development of novel cancer therapy,
the tumor types and underlying complexity of the biochemical
pathways determining inhibitor response remain poorly defined. It
has been previously suggested that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin
and analogs are particularly effective against a subset of tumors that
harbor PTEN‑deficiency and/or heightened AKT activation.19‑21
Similarly, the known PI3K inhibitors appear to kill certain cancer
cells with activated PI3K/AKT status.22‑24 Wortmannin‑derived
PI3K inhibitors PWT‑458 and PX‑866 efficiently suppress PI3K
signaling in vivo and elicit promising anticancer efficacy in preclin‑
ical xenograft tumors harboring the PTEN loss or constitutive PI3K
activation.25,26 Furthermore, a dual inhibitor of PI3K and mTOR
elicits a greater antitumor efficacy in the PTEN‑negative glioma.27
On the other hand, many cancer cell lines are intrinsically resistant
to mTOR inhibition by rapamycin analogs, and the classical PI3K
inhibitors are not known as broad spectrum inhibitors of cancer
cell growth. Intriguingly, a heightened AKT activation fails to
sensitize ovarian tumor cells that are already resistant to mTOR
inhibitors.28 Thus, while these previous observations highlighted a

critical dependence on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in
a subset of cancers, the activity status of the pathway per
se may not generally predict inhibitor response in broad
tumor types.
It is well known that malignant tumors typically acquire
numerous genetic alterations to support tumor growth,
and cooperation among various redundant biochemical
pathways may differentially determine the outcome of
PI3K inhibitor therapy. Hence, biochemical and molecular
understanding of the cancer cell sensitivity and resistance
is necessary in development of effective PI3K inhibitor
therapies. In this report, we have studied the functional
effects of new PI3K inhibitors in a panel of histologically
diverse cancer cells. We found that while the phosphoryla‑
tion of AKT was completely suppressed in all tested cell
lines, potent inhibition of growth was only observed in a
subset of cancer cells. A heightened PI3K/AKT activation
was linked to the sensitive phenotype but did not generally
predict inhibitor response. We have identified the aberrant
Ras/Raf/Mek/ERK signaling as a dominant determinant
of cancer cell resistance to PI3K inhibitors and highlight
combined targeting of PI3K and Mek1 pathways as an
effective anticancer therapy.

Results

WAY-266176 and WAY-266175 are potent and covalent
inhibitors of PI3K in vitro and in vivo. As we recently
reported,32 WAY‑266176 and WAY‑266175 (WAY‑176
and WAY‑175) are furan ring‑opened 17‑HWT irrevers‑
ible inhibitors of PI3Ka and isoforms. Both inhibitors are
>20‑fold selective over mTOR and are inactive against a
panel of protein kinases. Importantly, the serum half‑life
for 17‑HWT, WAY‑176 and WAY‑175 are 0.3 h, 2.3 h and
>24 h, respectively. The sharply improved serum stability
of WAY‑176/WAY‑175 resulted in sustained PI3K suppres‑
sion and anticancer efficacy in cell culture and in tumor
model in vivo.32 In the Rat1‑IGF1 stimulation model, both
WAY‑176 and WAY‑175 potently inhibited PI3K signaling
(Fig. 1A). To confirm that these inhibitors covalently target
PI3K in cancer cells, we performed inhibitor wash‑out
assay with WAY‑176, 17‑HWT and a reversible inhibitor
LY294002 in the PTEN‑negative U87MG glioma cells.
Inhibitors were added to cells for 1 h and then washed out
for 1 h and 3 h. Immunoblot analysis indicated that while
all three inhibitors suppressed PI3K signaling markers, the
phosphorylated forms of AKT, GSK3, S6K1 and 4EBP1,
at the end of 1 h drug incubation, no inhibitory effect
was seen for LY294002 in the wash‑out samples (Fig.
1B). In contrast, both wash‑out samples of WAY‑176‑ and
17‑HWT‑treated cells retained a nearly complete (1 h
wash‑out) and substantial (3 h wash‑out) suppression of PI3K
signaling markers (Fig. 1B). A similarly retained inhibitory activity
in the wash‑out assay was seen for WAY‑175 (not shown). Thus, like
17‑HWT, WAY‑176/WAY‑175 covalently inhibited cellular PI3K.
A single bolus IV injection of WAY‑176 (5 mg/kg) into nude mice
bearing U87MG glioma xenografts resulted in a rapid and sustained
suppression of PI3K signaling in the tumor for at least 6 h (Fig. 1C).

Together, these data further establish WAY‑176 and WAY‑175 as
potent and covalent inhibitors of PI3K in vitro and in vivo.
Activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway contributes to
susceptibility to PI3K inhibitors. To gain insight into the tumor
types that might be particularly susceptible to PI3K inhibitors, we
studied a panel of commonly used tumor cell lines. Expression of
PTEN, phospho‑AKT and phospho‑S6K1, two prominent signaling

markers of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, were analyzed by
immunoblotting using total cellular lysates prepared from serum
starved‑ and serum‑stimulated cells (Fig. 2A). Growth inhibition
IC50 values of WAY‑176 and WAY‑175 against each cell line were
determined in a 4‑day growth assay in which cells were exposed to
various concentrations of the inhibitors once on day 1 (Fig. 2B).
While WAY‑175 was more potent than WAY‑176 in growth assays
due to its superior serum stability, both inhibitors displayed a similar
inhibition profile with variable IC50 values ranging from low ng/mL
to high mg/mL (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the sensitive cells included
those breast and prostate lines possessing functional loss of PTEN

(MDA468, BT549, LNCap and
PC3MM2) or mutational activa‑
tion of the PI3K catalytic subunit
PIK3CA (MDA361, MCF7).10
The resistant cells included breast
MDA231, melanoma MDA435,
prostate DU145, colon HCT116
and lung A549. Notably, these
cells are not known to harbor
genetic alterations in the PI3K/
AKT pathway except for HCT116,
which contains the PIK3CA muta‑
tion.33 It is also noteworthy that
the sensitive MCF7 expressed a
low level of phospho‑AKT, whereas
resistant DU145, HCT116 and
A549 expressed moderate levels of
phospho‑AKT that were reduced
upon serum deprivation. Thus, a
heightened PI3K/AKT signaling
is linked to the sensitive pheno‑
type but does not generally predict
inhibitor response.
Differential modulation of cell
cycle factors and death markers
in sensitive versus resistant cells.
To study the cellular mechanism
that may account for the differen‑
tial sensitivity, we next performed
immunoblot analysis on a subset
of sensitive (LNCap, MDA361,
PC3MM2) and resistant (DU145,
MDA231, HCT116) cells after
exposure to various concentra‑
tions of WAY‑176, WAY‑175 and
LY294002 (5 mg/mL) for 6 h (Fig.
3). Phospho‑AKT was downregu‑
lated in all cells indicating that
PI3K was suppressed in both the
sensitive and resistant lines (Fig.
3A). Significantly, we observed
a rapid and nearly complete or
substantial inhibition of cyclin D1
and c‑Myc in the sensitive LNCap
and MDA361 cells in response
to WAY‑176, WAY‑175 and
LY294002, which correlated with the inhibition of phospho‑AKT
(Fig. 3A; Fig. 3B), left and middle panels). In contrast, both cyclin
D1 and c‑Myc were poorly or partially inhibited in the resistant
DU145 and MDA231 cells even at higher inhibitor concentra‑
tions, which did not correlate with the inhibition of phospho‑AKT
(Fig. 3A; Fig. 3B, left and middle panels). Since both cyclin D1
and c‑Myc are well established positive regulators of growth and
proliferation, the observed differential suppression of these proteins
may be critical factors underlying the differential susceptibility
of cancer cells to PI3K inhibitors. It was further shown that
PI3K inhibition in LNCap and MDA361 cells resulted in a rapid

cancer cell lines were plated in 10 cm culture plates for 24 h, then washed and refed with fresh media with or
without 10% serum for 24 h. Total lysates were prepared as described in Materials and Methods. Equal amounts

cancer cell lines were plated in 96-well culture plates at predetermined cell density (1,000 to 10,000 cells per
well) for 1 day, treated with vehicle or various doses of WAY-176 and WAY-175 (0.06-15 mg/mL) for 3 days.
Growth inhibitions were determined as described in Materials and Methods. IC50 values were determined (mean
of triplicate) and plotted.

induction of apoptosis as indicated by the
caspase‑mediated PARP cleavage in these
cells 6 h post exposure to the inhibitors
(Fig. 3B, right panel). Inhibition of PI3K
in the resistant DU145 and MDA231
cells did not cause PARP cleavage (Fig.
3B, right panel). We conclude from these
data that although the PI3K biochemical
pathway is inactivated by the inhibitors
in all studied cell lines, suppression of
growth in the sensitive cancer cells is
accompanied by a rapid and potent inhi‑
bition of cell cycle factors and induction
of apoptosis.
Resistant cancer cells display constitutively
phosphorylated ERK and are
sensitized by homologous replacement
of mutant Ki-Ras with the wild-type
Ki-Ras but not by PTEN deletion. Our
data thus far suggested a link between
deregulated PI3K/AKT signaling and
susceptibility to PI3K inhibitors in
certain cancer cells. However, the rela‑
tively poor suppression of growth in the
PIK3CA mutant HCT116 as well as the
lack of correlation of phospho‑AKT with
sensitivity in several additional cell lines
indicated that the activity status of the
PI3K pathway per se does not predict
sensitivity (Fig. 2). The Ras/Raf/Mek/
ERK signaling is frequently activated
in colon and other major cancers, and
may influence cellular response to PI3K
inhibition. To test this possibility we
conducted immunoblot analysis of the
expression and phosphorylation status of ERK in the same panel of
cell lines (Fig. 4A). We found that the resistant MDA231, MDA435,
DU145, HCT116 and A549 all exhibited an elevated phospho‑ERK
that remained elevated even after serum deprivation. In contrast,
the sensitive MDA361, MCF7, BT549, LNCap and PC3MM2 all
expressed low or barely detectable levels of phospho‑ERK. Notably,
the sensitive MDA468 expressed high phospho‑ERK that was
down‑regulated upon serum deprivation. The data in Figure 4A indi‑
cate that in addition to the PI3K pathway activation, the activity status
of cellular Ras/Raf/Mek/ERK is inversely correlated with sensitivity
to PI3K inhibitors. While the mechanism for elevated phospho‑ERK
in DU145 cells is not known, MDA231, MDA435, HCT116 and
A549 are known to harbor mutations in components of the Ras/Raf/
Mek/ERK pathway.33 We next compared HCT116 with its isogenic
line HKH, in which the mutant Ki‑Ras is replaced by the wild‑type
gene.30 WAY‑175 dose response data from four independent assays
demonstrated a 4.7‑fold reduction in IC50 in the HKH cells relative
to HCT116 cells (Fig. 4B, left panel) indicating that mutant Ras
plays a role in the cellular resistance. As expected, HKH expressed
a reduced level of phospho‑ERK as compared with HCT116 (Fig.
4B, right panel). Interestingly, WAY‑175/WAY‑176 and LY294002
all substantially inhibited c‑Myc expression in the Ras‑wild‑type

HKH cells but not in the Ras‑mutant HCT116 cells even at higher
inhibitor concentrations (Fig. 4B, right panel). To assess the effects of
PTEN status on sensitivity in these cells, we conducted similar assays
on the HCT116‑derived isogenic PTEN‑knockout cell pair (Fig.
4C, left panel). Surprisingly, in contrast to the observation with the
restoration of wild‑type Ras, WAY‑175 dose response obtained with
CR259 cells (PTEN‑/‑) was nearly identical to that of CR208 cells
(PTEN+/+, vector control) (Fig. 4C, right panel). Thus, we conclude
from the data in Figure 4 that deregulation of the Ras/Raf/Mek/ERK
signaling significantly reduces susceptibility of the cancer cells to
PI3K inhibitors.
Depletion of Mek1 sensitizes resistant cancer cells to PI3K
inhibitors. To further define the role of Ras/Raf/Mek/ERK signaling
in resistance to PI3K inhibitors, we depleted cellular Mek1, a key
effector kinase that phosphorylates ERK, via siRNA in the resistant
DU145, HCT116 and A549 cells. A substantial reduction (DU145
and HCT116) or a nearly complete knockdown (A549) of Mek1
expression could be confirmed (Fig. 5A). Both the control siRNA‑
and the Mek1 siRNA‑transfected cells were analyzed for growth
inhibition response after exposure to various doses of WAY‑175 and
WAY‑176. Depletion of Mek1 significantly sensitized these cells to
WAY‑175 (Fig. 5B). The reduction in WAY‑175 IC50 values in the

Mek1 depleted cells relative to the control cells were 6.6 fold in
DU145 (Fig. 5B, left panel), 18.3 fold in HCT116 (Fig. 5B, middle
panel), and 27.2 fold in A549 (Fig. 5B, right panel). A similar sensi‑
tization was seen for WAY‑176 (not shown).
A profoundly augmented growth suppression and apoptosis
induced by combination treatment with kinase inhibitors of Mek1
and PI3K. Because deregulation of the Ras/Raf/Mek/ERK pathways
is prevalent in major solid cancers and induces resistance to the
PI3K inhibitor therapy, we next studied the combination anti‑tumor
activity employing kinase inhibitors of Mek1 and PI3K (Fig. 6). In
HCT116 cells, cotreatment with a suboptimal dose of the Mek1

inhibitor UO126 (5 mg/mL) or CI‑1040
(1 mg/mL) resulted in a dramatic sensitiza‑
tion to growth suppression by WAY‑175
(Fig. 6A, left panel). The normalized IC50
values for WAY‑175, WAY‑175+UO126
and WAY‑175+CI‑1040 were 1.7 mg/mL,
0.11 mg/mL and 0.09 mg/mL, respectively.
The Mek1 inhibitors similarly sensitized
response to WAY‑176 (Fig. 6A, right panel).
The normalized IC50 values for WAY‑176,
WAY‑176+UO126 and WAY‑176+CI‑1040
were 7.6 mg/mL, 0.53 mg/mL and 0.47
mg/mL, respectively. Similar results were
obtained with additional cell lines of colon,
lung, breast and prostate (not shown). Cell
cycle analysis indicated that while a subop‑
timal dose of either WAY‑175 (1 mg/mL) or
WAY‑176 (7 mg/mL) alone increased cells in
G0/G1, the corresponding combinations with
CI‑1040 (1 mg/mL) resulted in a substantial
rise in the sub‑G1 population (Fig. 6B).
To determine the mode of cell death, we
measured caspase 3 activity in the cells treated
with the single inhibitors or various combi‑
nations (Fig. 6C). While a suboptimal dose
of UO126 (5 mg/mL) or CI‑1040 (1 mg/mL)
alone was inactive, both Mek1 inhibitors
greatly enhanced the levels of active caspase
3 when combined with WAY‑175 (Fig. 6C,
left panel) or WAY‑176 (Fig. 6C, right
panel) at 24 h post treatment. Together these
data demonstrate a profoundly augmented
suppression of growth and rapid induction
of apoptosis resulting from a combined
targeting of Mek1 and PI3K.
Inhibition of mitogenic signaling by
combined targeting of PI3K and Mek1. We
wished to examine the effects of combina‑
tion therapy on cellular mitogenic signaling
markers that may reflect the enhanced
suppression of growth. We performed
immunoblot analysis of HCT116 cells that
were treated singly with a low dose of
WAY‑175 (0.1 mg/mL), CI‑1040 (1 mg/mL)
or combination of the two inhibitors (Fig.
7A). As expected CI‑1040 alone inhibited
phospho‑ERK but had minimal effect on the signaling markers
of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. WAY‑175 alone inhibited
phospho‑AKT but only weakly inhibited the phosphorylation of
S6K1, 4EBP1 and GSK3, and caused minimal suppression of cyclin
D1 and c‑Myc. Interestingly, combination treatment with CI‑1040
and WAY‑175 resulted in a further reduction in the phosphorylated
forms of S6K1, 4EBP1 and GSK3. These biochemical changes were
accompanied by substantially reduced expression of both cyclin D1
and c‑Myc (Fig. 7A). We also examined the protein levels of cyclin
D1 and c‑Myc in the control‑ and Mek1‑siRNA transfected cells
without or with 6 h exposure to the low dose WAY‑175 (Fig. 7B). It

was apparent that 0.1 mg/mL of WAY‑175 caused greater suppression
of both cyclin D1 and c‑Myc in the Mek1‑depleted DU145 (Fig. 7B,
left panel), HCT116 (Fig. 7B, middle panel) and A549 (Fig. 7B,
right panel) as compared with the corresponding WAY‑175‑treated
control cells. Taken together, the results in Figures 6 and 7 strongly
indicate that in the resistant cells, combined targeting of Mek1 and
PI3K can efficiently inactivate mitogenic signaling pathways and
suppress cell cycle factors cyclin D1 and c‑Myc, which are likely
critical for the broad sensitization to the combination therapy.

Discussion

Due to its prevalent deregulation in human cancer, the PI3K
signaling pathway represents a rational target for cancer treatment.
WAY‑176 and WAY‑175 are potent PI3K inhibitors with prom‑
ising in vivo anticancer efficacy.32 In this report, we have employed
WAY‑176 and WAY‑175 to study cancer cell response to PI3K inhibi‑
tion. We found that while phospho‑AKT was efficiently inhibited in
all tested cells, potent growth suppression only occurred in a subset

of cancer cells. Consistent with the notion of “pathway addiction”,
several cell lines harboring mutations in components of the PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway were highly susceptible to these inhibitors
as indicated by potent suppression of growth and rapid induction
of apoptosis. WAY‑176, WAY‑175 and LY294002 all substantially
decreased expression of cyclin D1 and c‑Myc in the sensitive LNCap
and MDA361 cells, whereas a much weaker suppression of these
proteins was observed in the resistant DU145 and MDA231 cells.
These data suggest that expression of cyclin D1 and c‑Myc in these
cells is dependent on PI3K, and may be relevant biomarkers for
growth inhibitory response to PI3K inhibitors. While majority of the
sensitive cell lines displayed a heightened PI3K/AKT signaling, the
phospho‑AKT levels did not always correlate with susceptibility to
PI3K inhibition. Interestingly, HCT116 cells that contain activation
mutations in both PIK3CA and Ki‑Ras displayed a relatively resistant
phenotype, which was not sensitized by deletion of cellular PTEN.
Thus, while these findings together further establish the depen‑
dence of PI3K signaling for cell growth in certain cancer cells, the
activity status of the PI3K pathway per se will not generally predict
inhibitor response.
It is apparent from the current study that deregulated Ras/
Raf/Mek/ERK plays an important role in cellular resistance to
PI3K inhibitors. We observed that the resistant cells all displayed
an elevated and constitutively phosphorylated ERK presumably
resulting from mutations and/or deregulation in components of the
Ras/Raf/Mek/ERK pathway.33 In HCT116 cells activation mutation
in the Ki‑Ras appeared to be dominant over the activation of PI3K
in determining response. Consistent with this assessment, homolo‑
gous replacement of mutant Ras in these cells with the wild‑type
Ras enhanced sensitivity, whereas deletion of cellular PTEN did not.
The enhanced growth suppression in the Ras‑wild‑type HKH cells
correlated with a substantial reduction in c‑Myc expression. The role
of Ras/Raf/Mek/ERK pathway in resistance was further supported by
the knockdown studies on Mek1, a key effector kinase of the pathway.
siRNA mediated depletion of Mek1 in resistant DU145, HCT116
and A549 cells uniformly sensitized these cells for growth inhibition
by PI3K inhibitors, which was accompanied by a further decrease
in the levels of cyclin D1 and c‑Myc compared to the control cells.
Previous studies on the mTOR inhibitors have linked PTEN‑loss or
heightened AKT activation to inhibitor sensitivity.19‑21 Interestingly,
an activated AKT fails to sensitize ovarian tumor cells that are already
resistant to mTOR inhibitor rapamycin.28 Thus, these observations
collectively highlight redundant biochemical pathways of PI3K and
Ras/Raf/Mek/ERK in deregulation of key cell cycle machinery that
may critically determine a poor growth inhibitory response to PI3K
pathway inhibitors.
Oncogenic mutations in the Ras genes are highly common in
human malignancies, and can often lead to deregulated signaling
of both Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K pathways.34,35 It is well estab‑
lished that these biochemical pathways cooperate to promote tumor
growth, survival, and resistance to chemotherapy.36‑38 In the current
study, combination treatment with the kinase inhibitors of PI3K and
Mek1 resulted in an augmented suppression of growth in the PI3K
inhibitor‑resistant HCT116 colon cells. Further studies revealed
a similar sensitization in additional colon cell lines and other
tumor types including breast, prostate and lung (not shown).
Biochemical studies indicated that the combination therapy

potentiated dephosphorylation of several key components of
mitogenic signaling including phospho‑S6K1, phospho‑4EBP1
and phospho‑GSK3, which together negatively impact cellular
machinery of protein synthesis and gene transcription. Lastly, we
found that the levels of cyclin D1 and/or c‑Myc were substantially
down‑regulated in resistant cancer cells in response to combination
therapy. Together, these observations provide cellular and biochem‑
ical evidence supporting combination treatment with inhibitors of
PI3K and Mek1 in broad tumor types.

In summary, results from the
current study have provided insight
into the cellular and biochemical
pathways that regulate cancer cell
response to PI3K inhibitor therapy.
These findings will be useful in
future development of clinical
strategies that target PI3K and
Raf/Mek/ERK pathways for cancer
treatment.

Cell culture. Cell lines of
Rat1, U87MG, MDA‑MB‑468,
BT549, MCF7, MDA‑MB‑361,
MDA‑MB‑231, MDA‑MB‑435,
LNCap, DU145, HCT116
and A549 were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC). PC3MM2 was obtained

Wyeth Discovery Oncology. The
isogenic lines HCT116 (parent)
and HKH (mutant Ki‑Ras replaced
with the wild‑type Ki‑Ras)30 were
obtained from Dr. Kim Arndt,
Wyeth Discovery Oncology. The
HCT116‑derived isogenic PTEN
knockout cell lines CR208 (vector
control) and CR259 (PTEN‑/‑)
were kindly provided by Dr. Bert
Vogelstein and Dr. Carlo Rago
(Johns Hopkins University). All
cells were maintained in a 37°C
incubator with 5% CO2, and were
cultured using standard cell culture methods.
Mek1/2 depletion via RNA interference. DU145, HCT116 and
A549 cells were plated in 10 cm culture dish at 30–50% confluence.
One day after plating, cells were transfected with 80 nM siRNAs of
the luciferase (control) or Mek1 (CCCGCAAUCCGGAACCAGA
UCAUAA)31 using lipofecatmine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Cells
were replated 24 h later in the 96‑well culture plates for growth assays
(see below), or 6‑well culture plates for immunoblotting at 72 h post
transfection.

of Mek1 and PI3K. (A) HCT116 growth inhibition curve in response to WAY-175 (left panel) or WAY-176
(right panel) in combination with Mek1 inhibitors. Cells were plated in 96-well plates (1,000 cells per well) for 1
day, treated with vehicle, various doses of WAY-175 or WAY-176 alone, or with CI-1040 (1 mg/ml) or UO126
(5 mg/ml). A set of wells were treated with CI-1040 or UO126 alone. Cells were exposed to the inhibitors for
3 days. Growth inhibitions were assayed as described in Materials and Methods. For calculation of normalized
IC50 values, growth inhibitions in the combination treatment groups were normalized against the value obtained
with the corresponding Mek1 inhibitor alone. (B) Cell cycle analysis. HCT116 cells were treated for 24 h with
vehicle, WAY-175 (1 mg/ml), WAY-176 (7 mg/ml), CI-1040 (1 mg/ml), combination of WAY-175 and CI-1040,
or combination of WAY-176 and CI-1040. Treated cells were harvested and analyzed for cell cycle profile as
described in Materials and Methods. Percent of cells in G0/G1 and sub-G1 are plotted. (C) Caspase assays of
cells treated with inhibitors. HCT116 cells were plated and treated similarly as in (B). Caspase 3/7 activities were
measured 24 h later as described in Materials and Methods.

Tumor cell growth assays. Cells were plated in 96‑well
culture plates at 1000 to 3000 cells per well. One day following
plating, cells were treated with various doses of WAY‑266175
or WAY‑266176 alone or with a low constant dose of CI‑1040
(1 mg/mL) or UO126 (5 mg/mL). In all combination assays,
the single and combination treatments were performed in the
same 96‑well plate along with control wells treated with vehicle
(DMSO) or alone with the same dose of CI‑1040 or UO126
included in combination. For assays of siRNA‑transfected
DU145, HCT116 and A549, cells were replated in 96‑well plates
24 h post transfection. Inhibitors were added to cells 2 days after
replating (3 days after transfection). Three days after exposure
to inhibitors, viable cell densities were determined by MTS
assay. The assays were performed using an assay kit (Promega)
following the protocol supplied with the kit. The assay results
were read in a 96‑well plate reader by measuring absorbance at
490 nm. The effect of each treatment was calculated as percent
of control growth relative to the vehicle DMSO‑treated cells
grown in the same culture plate.
Cell cycle analysis and apoptosis assay. For cell cycle
analysis, cells were seeded in 96‑well culture plates at 10,000
cells/well for 24 h. Cells were then exposed to various inhibi‑
tors for 24 h. Following treatment, cells were harvested, washed
with PBS, and fixed overnight at ‑20°C in 70% ethanol. Cells
were washed, stained with propidium iodide, and analyzed for
cell cycle profile (acquired 5000 cells/well) on Guava PCA‑96
instrument (Guava Technologies) according to the Guava Cell
Cycle Protocol. Apoptosis was also measured 24 h post inhibitor
treatment using Apo‑ONE Caspase‑3/7 assay kit (Cat # G7791,
Promega). Assay mix was added to cells and incubated at room
temperature for 3 h with gentle mixing using a plate shaker.
The fluorescence of each well was read using the Victor plate
reader (Wallac‑PerkinElmer). Each experimental plate contains
blank wells (without cells) as background fluorescence that
was subtracted from all wells to obtain experimental values.
Data are expressed as relative fluorescent units (RFLU) or as
Apo‑ONE units.
Protein lysates and immunoblotting. For total cell lysates
of xenograft tumors and in vitro cultured tumor cells grown in
serum‑stimulated or serum‑depleted conditions, cells from culture
dishes or xenograft tumors (dissected and minced) were lysed
in lysis buffer (25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM
b‑glycerophosphate, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.25 mM
EDTA 1% NP‑40, 10 mM Na3VO4, 10 mg/ml Aprotinin, 10
mg/mL Leupeptin, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM Microcystin LR and 0.1%
2‑mercaptoethanol). Crude lysates were sonicated and clarified
by centrifugation. For in vitro cell culture treatment with various
inhibitors, total cellular lysates were prepared using NuPAGE‑LDS
sample buffer (Invitrogen). Crude lysates were sonicated and then
clarified by centrifugation. Equal amounts of proteins were subjected
to immunoblotting analysis using NuPAGE electrophoresis system
(Invitrogen). Antibodies for PTEN, P‑AKT (S473 and T308),
total AKT, P‑S6K (T389), P‑GSK3 (S9/21), P‑ERK (T202/Y204),
P‑4EBP1 (T46), 4EBP1, cyclin D1 and Mek1 were obtained from
Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies for c‑Myc and PARP were
obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. b‑actin antibody was
from Chemicon International. Immunoblots were probed with

primary and secondary antibodies following manufacturer’s instruc‑
tions and detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham
Pharmacia).
PI3K inhibition in xenograft tumors. U87MG glioma cells were
implanted subcutaneously in female nude mice. When tumor size
reached 400 mm3, they were randomized into treatment groups.
The tumor bearing mice were dosed once with either PBS or
WAY‑266176 (formulated in PBS) intravenously (IV). At the indi‑
cated times post dosing, tumors were dissected. Total protein lysates
were prepared, quantified, and subjected to immunoblotting (as
described previously in ref. 25).
