Inhibitors of the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
have shown sporadic activity in cancer trials, leading to
confusion about the appropriate clinical setting for their use.
Here we show that loss of the Von Hippel-Lindau tumor
suppressor gene (VHL) sensitizes kidney cancer cells to the
mTOR inhibitor CCI-779 in vitro and in mouse models. Growth
arrest caused by CCI-779 correlates with a block in translation
of mRNA encoding hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1A), and is
rescued by expression of a VHL-resistant HIF1A cDNA lacking
the 5¢ untranslated region. VHL-deficient tumors show
increased uptake of the positron emission tomography (PET)
tracer fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in an mTOR-dependent
manner. Our findings provide preclinical rationale for
prospective, biomarker-driven clinical studies of mTOR
inhibitors in kidney cancer and suggest that FDG-PET scans
may have use as a pharmacodynamic marker in this setting.

The mTOR kinase inhibitor CCI-779 induces objective responses in
about 10% and disease stabilization in about 50% of individuals with
metastatic renal carcinoma1. This finding of selective activity in a
subset of individuals raises the possibility that responders share a
common molecular phenotype that renders these tumors dependent
on mTOR for growth and/or survival. The most common molecular
abnormality in renal cell carcinoma is loss of VHL, which is found in
about 50–70% of sporadic cases2. VHL encodes an E3 ligase that
promotes the ubiquitination of the a-subunits of the hypoxiainducible
transcription factors HIF1, HIF2 and HIF3, leading to
their degradation by the proteasome. Consequently, renal carcinomas
with mutations in VHL have high steady-state levels of HIF expression.
Functional studies show that HIF is sufficient for transformation
caused by loss of VHL, thereby establishing HIF as the primary
oncogenic driver in kidney cancers3,4.
HIF protein expression is dependent on mTOR in certain cellular
contexts5,6. The 5¢ untranslated regions of mRNAs encoding both
HIF-1a and HIF-2a contain 5¢ terminal oligopolypyrimidine (TOP)
tracts that can regulate translation in response to S6 kinase activation7.
Translation of mRNAs bearing 5¢-TOP sequences is dependent on
mTOR because mTOR regulates a kinase cascade, involving S6 kinase

and its substrate S6 ribosomal protein, which is required for efficient
translation of these messages. This connection between translation of
HIF and mTOR raised the possibility that the clinical activity of
mTOR inhibitors in a subset of renal cell carcinoma may be explained,
in part, by loss of VHL.
We evaluated this possibility by constructing isogenic pairs of
human renal carcinoma cell lines, differing only in VHL expression
levels, using stable RNA knockdown by lentiviral transfer of VHLspecific
shRNA (SN12C and SN12C-VHL shRNA; ACHN and ACHNVHL
shRNA). As expected, VHL protein levels were reduced and
HIF-1a and HIF-2a protein levels were increased in cells stably
expressing the knockdown constructs (Fig. 1a), whereas vector-only
and a control nonspecific shRNA sequence had no effect (Supplementary
Fig. 1 online). Cells containing VHL-specific shRNA proliferated
more rapidly than their isogenic parental counterparts
(Fig. 1b), in keeping with previous reports that VHL addback to
VHL-null cells suppressed growth8,9. Protein levels of the HIF target
genes, SLC2A1 (encoding glucose transporter-1), CA9 (carbonic
anhydrase-9) and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), were
all increased in VHL knockdown cells, even under normoxic conditions
(Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 2 online10,11).
To assess the role of mTOR in proliferation mediated by knockdown
of VHL, we exposed both isogenic human kidney tumor cell line
pairs to the mTOR inhibitor CCI-779. Parental cells were unaffected
by 10 nM CCI-779, whereas growth of cells treated with SN12C-VHL
shRNA (similar results seen with ACHN-CSCG and ACGB-VHL cells;
data not shown) was reduced by 70% in a dose-dependent fashion.
When the isogenic lines were grown as subcutaneous xenografts in
SCID mice, stable knockdown of VHL again conferred a growth
advantage and increased sensitivity to mTOR inhibition even though
there was efficient biochemical blockade of mTOR in parental and
VHL knockdown xenografts (Fig. 1c–e). The growth of two renal
carcinoma cell lines from the NCI-60 panel with natural mutations in
VHL (786-0 and A498) was also inhibited by CCI-779 (Supplementary
Fig. 3 online).
In addition to cell-autonomous effects, inhibitors of mTOR have
antiangiogenic activity, as growth of endothelial cells is dependent
on mTOR in certain settings12. Because angiogenesis is a central

histologic feature of renal carcinoma, inhibitors of mTOR could also
impair tumor growth through effects on tumor vasculature.
Xenografts from VHL knockdown cell lines were more vascular
compared to parental tumors (P o 0.0033), and treatment with
CCI-779 led to a 50% decrease in microvessel density (Supplementary
Fig. 2 online). Given that the proangiogenic gene VEGF is a target of
HIF, the antiangiogenic properties of CCI-779 might also be a
consequence of direct effects of the drug on tumor cells. Indeed,
VEGF levels were increased in VHL knockdown cells and reduced by
CCI-779 treatment in vitro and in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 2 online).
Collectively, these experiments establish that loss of VHL sensitizes
renal carcinoma cells to growth inhibition by inhibitors of mTOR.
One potential mechanism is that translation of mRNA encoding HIF1a
is blocked by inhibitors of mTOR in VHL-null cells because of 5¢
TOP sequences in the HIF1A mRNA7. Yet mTOR is inhibited during
hypoxic conditions at a time when HIF-1a protein levels are constitutively
elevated13, making it difficult to understand how mTOR
might differentially affect expression of HIF-1a in these two contexts.
To reconcile this apparent paradox, we examined the effects of CCI779
on HIF protein levels in VHL-intact and VHL knockdown cells
under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. As expected13, HIF
protein expression was increased in VHL-intact cells by hypoxia, and
baseline mTOR activity was reduced compared to normoxia (Supplementary
Fig. 4 online). Expression of HIF-1a and HIF-2a was
reduced within 16 h, under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions,
after treatment with CCI-779. Similarly, treatment with CCI-779

reduced the expression of HIF-2a and protein products of the HIF
target genes SLC2A1, CA9 and VEGF. VEGF was similarly reduced.
These changes correlated precisely with inhibition of mTOR, as
measured by reduced phosphorylation of downstream substrates
eIF4G and S6 (Fig. 2a,b). Therefore, inhibition of mTOR caused by
treatment with CCI-779 impairs expression of HIF under both
normoxic and hypoxic conditions. A possible explanation for the
persistent high levels of HIF during hypoxia despite reduced mTOR
activity is that the magnitude of mTOR inhibition induced by hypoxia
is insufficient to block expression of HIF (Supplementary Fig. 4).
To address the mechanism by which CCI-779 reduces expression of
HIF, we examined levels of mRNA encoding HIF and protein stability
after treatment with CCI-779. There was no effect on HIF1A mRNA
(Fig. 2c). Potential effects on HIF protein stability were assessed in two
ways. The proteasome inhibitor MG-132 did not rescue HIF-1a levels
in CCI-779–treated VHL knockdown cells, implying that CCI-779
does not induce degradation of HIF (Fig. 2d). Furthermore, CCI-779
did not alter the half-life of HIF in VHL knockdown cells in
cycloheximide-treatment experiments (Supplementary Fig. 5 online).
Therefore, we focused our attention on translation of mRNA encoding
HIF-1a through 5¢ TOP regulatory sequences. Insertion of native
HIF1A 5¢ TOP sequences into a luciferase reporter conferred CCI-779
sensitivity to reporter protein expression (Fig. 2e). We obtained
similar findings when we placed the native 5¢ TOP sequence upstream
of a HIF1A cDNA. CCI-779 treatment resulted in a dose-dependent
decrease in HIF-1a (by 65%) in the presence of the 5¢ TOP sequence,

but a 38% decrease in HIF-1a without the 5¢ TOP (Fig. 2f). Although
5¢ TOP sequences clearly account for some of the effects of CCI-779
on levels of HIF-1a, additional sequences in the HIF1A cDNA may
also have a role.
These experiments establish that CCI-779–mediated growth inhibition
of VHL-deficient renal carcinoma cell lines correlates with
reduced translation of mRNA encoding HIF. Prior work showed
that HIF mutants resistant to VHL-mediated degradation can rescue
VHL-mediated tumor suppression. To provide functional evidence
that reduced HIF levels are responsible for decreased growth in CCI779–treated
cells, we transduced SN12C VHL knockdown cells with
VHL-resistant HIF1A or HIF2A mutant cDNAs lacking the 5¢ TOP
sequences3,14. As expected, both HIF mutants (and downstream target
genes) were stably expressed in the presence or absence of CCI-779,
despite inhibition of mTOR as measured by phosphorylation of eIF4G
and S6 (Fig. 3a). Notably, both mutants rescued VHL knockdown cells
from the growth-inhibitory effects of CCI-779 treatment in vitro
(Fig. 3b) and in xenograft experiments (Fig. 3c). Therefore, the
antiproliferative activity of mTOR inhibitors in VHL-null kidney
cancer cells is mediated through its effect on translation of mRNA
encoding HIF.
These results have important implications for clinical trials of CCI779
in renal carcinoma as VHL status could serve as a biomarker for
subject selection. VHL data were not collected in the completed phase
2 studies in renal cancer, but estimates of the frequency of mutation in
VHL can be made from historical data. The anticipated VHL mutation
rate (B50%) is clearly higher than the objective response rate

(B10%) but comparable to the stable disease rate (B50%). As we
observed growth arrest (not tumor regression) in our preclinical
models, stable disease may be the expected clinical outcome with
inhibitors of mTOR in this setting. Alternatively, additional molecular
lesions such as expression of Bcl-2 could mitigate the response to
inhibition of mTOR15. In either case, our findings provide preclinical
rationale for correlating VHL status with clinical response in future
trials, as this might guide future subject selection.
Clinical decision-making would be greatly enhanced by a noninvasive
tool for monitoring VHL status and response to inhibition of
mTOR. Genes of the glycolytic pathway (including SLC2A1) were
recently linked to activation of HIF in an AKT-driven model of
prostate cancer15. These findings raise the possibility that HIF-driven
tumors might accumulate fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), the widely used
clinical tracer for positron emission tomography (PET). We compared
18F-FDG uptake in both VHL knockdown xenograft models relative to
parental tumor cells. VHL knockdown tumors in both models grown
as subcutaneous flank masses reproducibly showed at least a twofold
increase in FDG uptake that was reduced to baseline within 24 h with
CCI-779. In contrast, paclitaxel had no effect on the FDG-PET uptake,
suggesting an mTOR-specific effect (Fig. 4). Clinical PET studies in
individuals with kidney cancer indicate that a substantial proportion
(B50–70%) of these tumors are FDG avid16, consistent with the
expected frequency of VHL loss. These results raise the possibility that
FDG-PET scanning could be used to noninvasively document inhibition
of mTOR in individuals with renal carcinoma before and shortly
after initiation of mTOR inhibitor therapy, analogous to the use of

with imatinib17,18.
Clinical activity has been reported in renal carcinoma using any one
of several antiangiogenesis agents that target VEGF (bevacizumab) or
its receptor VEGFR (SU11248, Bay 43-9006)19. Although inhibitors of
mTOR also have antiangiogenic properties12, our results showing that
HIF mutants rescue growth suppression caused by treatment of CCI779
in mice argue that the antiangiogenic effects of mTOR inhibitors
in renal carcinoma are mediated primarily through direct effects on
tumor cells. Although the contribution of the microenvironment

needs further study20, this mechanistic understanding provides a
rationale for exploring combination therapy using inhibitors of
mTOR and the VEGF-VEGFR pathway in renal cancer to block
the effects of the activation of the HIF pathway (Supplementary
Fig. 6 online).
Prior work has shown that PI3 kinase–AKT pathway–driven transformation
is dependent on mTOR because mTOR is a crucial
component of a downstream kinase cascade, consistent with the
notion of ‘pathway addiction’ in tumor cells21. Here we provide
evidence for kinase dependence through a conceptually distinct
mechanism. In renal cell carcinoma caused by loss of VHL, the crucial
role of mTOR is not transduction of the oncogenic signal downstream
of HIF. Rather, translation of HIF mRNA is dependent on mTOR
owing to the presence of upstream regulatory signals in its 5¢
untranslated region regulated by substrates of mTOR. This model
predicts for a highly favorable therapeutic index because decreased
translation of mRNA encoding HIF in normal tissues should be
inconsequential, as HIF is already rapidly degraded through VHL. A
similar mechanism might also be responsible for clinical activity of
CCI-779 in mantle cell lymphoma, where the driving oncogenic lesion
is presumed to be cyclin D1. Translation of CCND1 mRNA, which is

produced at increased levels as a consequence of the Bcl-1 translocation
that defines these tumors, has also been shown to be dependent
on mTOR in certain systems22. Future clinical trials of mTOR
inhibitors might be guided by these distinct conceptual mechanisms
of tumor dependence on mTOR.

DNA constructs and PCR primers. We constructed the pCSUVCG (U6-
shRNA-VHL-CMV-GFP) by ligating the BamHI/EcoRI digests of pCSCG and
the U6-shRNA-VHL PCR product23. We performed the U6-shRNA-VHL PCR
using a hU6-containing plasmid at an annealing temperature of 60 1C with the
primers 5¢-GGGGGATCCCAAGGTCGGGCAGGAAGAGGGCCTATTTCC-3¢
and 5¢-GGGGAATTCAAAAAGACCTGGAGCGGCTGACACTCCTTGAAGTG
TCAGCCGCTCCAGGTCGGTGTTTCGTCCTTTCCACAAGATATATAA-3¢. We
identified the native 5¢ untranslated region of HIF1A using Genebrowser, which
contains previously identified TOP sequences7. Using human fetal brain cDNA
(Marathon, Invitrogen) as template, we generated a 387-bp fragment containing
268 bp of the 5¢ untranslated region and 119 bp of the coding region
using the primers 5¢-GGGAGATCTGGGGACAGGAGGATCGCC-3¢ and 5¢-GG
GAAGCTCATAAAAAACTTTAGATTC-3¢. We subcloned the PCR product into
the PCR 2.1 TA cloning vector, verified it by sequencing and subsequently
cleaved it with BglII and ligated it into the BglII site of the MSCV-puro-HIF1A
cDNA, to create the HIF1A 5¢ TOP chimeric gene. We cleaved the HIF1A
5¢ untranslated region PCR product with BglII/XhoI and subsequently
ligated it directionally, 5¢ to the renilla luciferase–coding sequence of the
pDL-N vector (gift from A. Dasgupta, University of California, Los Angeles).
The prolyl hydroxylation–defective mutants of p-Babe-puro-HA-HIF-1a
(P564A) and HIF-2a (P405A; P531A) were a gift from W.G. Kaelin (DanaFarber
Cancer Institute).

Immunoblot analysis and luciferase assays. We lysed cells and xenograft
tumors in EBC lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 120 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet
P-40) or high-detergent buffer (2% SDS), respectively, and supplemented them
with complete protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Calbiochem). We
resolved protein extracts by SDS-PAGE and transferred them to nitrocellulose
membranes. After blocking in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 5% nonfat milk,
we probed the membranes with following: mouse VHL-specific monoclonal
antibody (1:400, Oncogene Research Sciences), mouse HIF-1aspecific
monoclonal
antibody (1:250, BD Pharmingen), mouse HIF-2aspecific
monoclonal
antibody (1:500, Novus Biologicals), rabbit GLUT-1–specific polyclonal
antibody (1:1,000, Alpha Diagnostic), rabbit CA-IX–specific polyclonal antibody
(1:500, Novus Biologicals), rabbit phosphorylated eIF4G-S1108–specific
polyclonal antibody (1:1,000, Cell Signaling), rabbit phosphorylated S6
ribosomal protein S235/236–specific polyclonal antibody (1:1,000, Cell
Signaling) or mouse b-actin–specific monoclonal antibody (1:5,000, Sigma),
diluted in TBS with 4% BSA. We performed densitometric analysis using
ImageQuant software.
For hypoxia treatment, we placed cells into a modular hypoxia chamber
(Billups Rothenburg) with a regulated environment of 1% O2, 5% CO2
and 94% N2 or cobalt chloride (CoCl2, Sigma) stock solution (100 mM in
water) for 16 h.
We transfected SN12C-CSCG with either p-DLN-HIF-5¢ TOP (5¢ TOP LUX)
or p-DLN Vector (Vector LUX) in the presence of Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) followed by selection in G418. We assayed luciferase activity in
triplicate, 24 h after treatment with either 10 nM CCI-779 or vehicle and
normalized it to the intracellular protein concentrations within each sample.

In vitro and in vivo growth experiments. We maintained SN12C, ACHN, 786-
0 and A498 (NCI60, DTP); SN12C-CSCG, ACHN-CSCG, SN12C-CSCG-VHL
shRNA and ACHN-CSCG-VHL shRNA in DMEM supplemented with 10%
FBS. For in vitro experiments, we plated 5  104 cells and treated them with a
single dose of 1 or 10 nM CCI-779 (gift of J. Gibbons, Wyeth) or vehicle
(ethanol). On day 5 after treatment, we trypsinized cells, resuspended them
in DMEM with 10% FBS and counted them using the VI-Cell XR automated
cell-viability analyzer (Beckmann Coulter). We performed cell counts in

triplicate and repeated them on at least three independent occasions. We
measured in vivo tumorigenicity by subcutaneous injection of 5  105 SN12CCSCG,
ACHN-CSCG, SN12C-CSCG-VHL shRNA, ACHN-CSCG-VHL
shRNA, SN12C-CSCG-VHL shRNA-pBABE, SN12C-CSCG-VHL shRNApBABE-HA-HIF-2a
(P405A; P531A) cells in 100 ml of Matrigel (Collaborative
Biomedical) into the flanks of SCID mice. We measured tumor size weekly in
three dimensions using calipers as previously described23. When tumors
reached 200 mm3
, we administered 0.1 mg/kg/d CCI-779 or vehicle to all
tumors. All mouse experiments were performed in compliance with the
guidelines of the Animal Research Committee of the University of California
at Los Angeles.
Micro-PET imaging. We synthesized 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)
using a standard method24. We conducted PET scans with the MicroPET
Primate 4-ring system (P4; Concorde Microsystems) as previously described.
We administered CCI-779 intraperitoneally at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg every 12 h;
similarly, we intraperitoneally injected paclitaxel (Sigma) (200 mg; 8 mg/kg)
every 12 h. We injected mice intravenously with FDG (7.4 MBq) and imaged
them 1 h after tracer injection for 15 min in three independent experiments.
For image reconstruction, we first sorted list-mode data into three-dimensional
sinograms, followed by Fourier rebinning and two-dimensional filtered backprojection
(FBP) reconstruction using a Ramp filter with one-half of the
Nyquist frequency as the cut-off frequency. The reconstructed spatial image
resolution is B2.2 mm. For image analysis, we manually placed regions of
interest (ROI) around the tumor and the liver on transaxial images. The tumor
ROI was defined in the slice with maximum tracer uptake; we placed the liver
ROI in the slice with the largest cross-sectional area of the hepatic blood pool.
Tracer uptake by the tumors was expressed as the ratio between the maximum
intratumoral and mean hepatic counts per pixel. All quantitative values are
reported as mean ± s.e.m.
