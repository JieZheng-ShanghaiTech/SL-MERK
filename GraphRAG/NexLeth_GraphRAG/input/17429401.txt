Abundant evidence suggests that a unifying principle governing the
molecular pathology of cancer is the co-dependent aberrant regulation
of core machinery driving proliferation and suppressing
apoptosis1
. Anomalous proteins engaged in support of this tumorigenic
regulatory environment most probably represent optimal
intervention targets in a heterogeneous population of cancer cells.
The advent of RNA-mediated interference (RNAi)-based functional
genomics provides the opportunity to derive unbiased comprehensive
collections of validated gene targets supporting critical biological
systems outside the framework of preconceived notions of
mechanistic relationships. We have combined a high-throughput
cell-based one-well/one-gene screening platform with a genomewide
synthetic library of chemically synthesized small interfering
RNAs for systematic interrogation of the molecular underpinnings
of cancer cell chemoresponsiveness. NCI-H1155, a human nonsmall-cell
lung cancer line, was employed in a paclitaxel-dependent
synthetic lethal screen designed to identify gene targets that specifically
reduce cell viability in the presence of otherwise sublethal
concentrations of paclitaxel. Using a stringent objective statistical
algorithm to reduce false discovery rates below 5%, we isolated a
panel of 87 genes that represent major focal points of the autonomous
response of cancer cells to the abrogation of microtubule
dynamics. Here we show that several of these targets sensitize lung
cancer cells to paclitaxel concentrations 1,000-fold lower than
otherwise required for a significant response, and we identify
mechanistic relationships between cancer-associated aberrant gene
expression programmes and the basic cellular machinery required
for robust mitotic progression.
Paclitaxel and related taxanes are routinely used in the treatment of
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other epithelial malignancies.
Although objective responses and survival benefits are seen,
complete responses are uncommon. Half-maximal inhibitory concentrations
(IC50 values) of Paclitaxel in a panel of 29 human primary
lung-tumour-derived cell lines spanned a wide range of concentrations,
from 1 nM to more than 1 mM (M.P., L.G. and J.D.M., unpublished
observations). From this panel, we selected the NSCLC line
NCI-H1155 for a genome-wide paclitaxel synthetic-lethal screen,
given the IC50 (about 50 nM) for this line, which is tenfold that
observed for many other lines with similar proliferation rates. A
high-efficiency, high-throughput short interfering RNA (siRNA)
reverse transfection protocol was designed on the basis of our observations
that transient trypsin-mediated suspension of adherent cultures
markedly enhances the cellular uptake of liposome/nucleic acid
particles2,3 (Supplementary Fig. 1a).
We employed a library of 84,508 siRNAs corresponding to four
unique siRNA duplexes, targeting each of 21,127 unique human genes

arrayed in a one-gene–one-well format on 96-well microtitre plates
(Supplementary Table 1). Transfections were performed in sextuplicate
for triplicate analysis in the presence and the absence of paclitaxel
(Supplementary Fig. 1b). A 48-h exposure to 10 nM paclitaxel was
used as an otherwise innocuous dose that was in range of a significant
response at a tenfold higher drug concentration (Supplementary Fig.
1c). Cell viability was measured using ATP concentration, and raw
values were normalized to internal reference control samples on each
plate to permit plate-to-plate comparisons4 (Supplementary Table 1
and Supplementary Fig. 1f). Each siRNA pool was assigned a viability
ratio calculated as mean viability in paclitaxel divided by mean viability
in the absence of drug (meanpaclitaxel/meancarrier) (Supplementary
Fig. 1d).
An objective protocol for the selection of significant ‘hits’ was
derived to combine reproducibility of testing with magnitude of
response (Supplementary Fig. 1e, and Methods described therein).
First, we set a 5% false discovery rate (FDR) by using two-sample
t-tests from the triplicate analysis together with P-value corrections
for the multiplicity of testing5–8 (Supplementary Table 2). Second, we
selected all samples that both satisfied a 5% FDR and were present in
the 2.5-centile rank of the viability ratios (Supplementary Table 3 and
Supplementary Fig. 1e). A set of 87 candidate paclitaxel-sensitizer
loci, defined as ‘high-confidence hits’, was identified that satisfied
these criteria (Table 1). Retests of a subset of these candidates with
independently synthesized siRNA pools reproduced a significant response
to 10 nM paclitaxel (Fig. 1a).
A 5% FDR is a highly stringent cut-off that may produce many false
negatives. Nonetheless, this cut off returned many candidates with
overlappingfunctional relationships, including macromolecular complexes,
receptor–ligand pairs, and products of related aberrant geneexpression
programmes (Table 1, Fig. 1b–e, and Supplementary Table
4). Most striking was the presence of a large group of core components
of the proteasome (Fig. 1b), consistent with numerous empirical
observations of enhanced sensitivity to paclitaxel in cancer cells after
proteasome inhibition. Multiple targets encoding proteins involved in
the dynamics and function of microtubules were also isolated9
(Table 1). Relaxing the FDR to 10% returned most of the known main
components of the c-tubulin ring complex (c-TuRC), a central element
of the microtubule organizing centres that nucleate the formation
of the mitotic spindle10 (Fig. 1c, and Supplementary Table 4).
Isolation of these components is evocative of a successful primary
screen, because the mitotic spindle apparatus is exquisitely sensitive
to the inhibition of microtubule dynamics by paclitaxel and is probably
the biologically relevant drug target in cancer cells11. The probabilities
of this extent of enrichment of proteasome subunits and of
c-TuRC subunits by random chance are 1 in 1010 (P # 0.0000000001)

and 1 in 3 3 109 (c-TuRC, P # 0.000000003), respectively, as calculated
by hypergeometric distribution analysis.
A surprising observation was the enrichment of genes, the expression
of which is normally restricted to the testis. Four of these are
known to encode tumour antigens that are markedly upregulated in
many tumour types including NSCLC, breast cancer and melanoma
(Fig. 1e; P # 0.003 (hypergeometric distribution)). The restricted
expression pattern and immunogenicity of cancer/testis antigens
(CT antigens) has driven forward efforts for their use in cancer vaccines
even in the absence of functional information12. Their identification
in this screen suggests the obligatory participation of some
CT antigens in aberrant cancer-cell regulatory programmes.

To probe the extent of chemosensitization that can be conferred by
target gene depletion, a panel representing six functionally diverse
groups from the ‘high-confidence’ hit list was selected. This panel
included the following: CT-antigen ACRBP; the proteasome subunit
PSMA6; the c-TuRC protein TUBGCP2; a heparin sulphate transferase,
HS6ST2, with significantly enriched expression in lung tumour
tissue compared with normal lung (L.G. and J.D.M., unpublished
observations); a vacuolar ATPase subunit, ATP6V0D2, expressed
from a locus amplified in several lung cancer lines; and FGD4, a
CDC42 activator. As controls for ‘off-target’ siRNA phenomena,
we verified that each siRNA pool resulted in target gene knockdown,
that at least two single siRNAs would recapitulate the phenotype

when tried separately, and that distinct pools of four more independent
siRNAs against each gene also resulted in target knockdown and
paclitaxel sensitization (Supplementary Fig. 2a–d).
We next examined the consequence of target depletion on responses
to a broad range of concentrations of paclitaxel, vinorelbine
and gemcitabine. Paclitaxel and vinorelbine impair mitotic spindle
assembly through independent mechanisms that suppress microtubule
dynamics11. In contrast, gemcitabine induces replicationstress-dependent
apoptosis through DNA chain termination13.
Several targets displayed significant collaboration with paclitaxel
concentrations 1,000-fold below that used for the primary screen
(Fig. 2a). Exposure to paclitaxel for a further 24–48 h magnified these
differences: some groups responded to paclitaxel concentrations
10,000-fold lower than otherwise required (Fig. 2d). Cell survival
curves and colony assays suggest that the decrease in cell number is
a consequence of cell death rather than a transient delay in proliferation
(Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). Some targets also significantly
enhanced sensitivity to vinorelbine but, for the most part, only at
concentrations at which vinorelbine alone detectably impaired cell
viability (Fig. 2b). In contrast, target depletion had no remarkable

consequence on the maximally effective concentration of gemcitabine
in H1155 cells, although the non-responding cell population
was decreased or eliminated in all cases (Fig. 2c).
The apparent synergy that we observed between target depletion
and paclitaxel, in comparison with other chemotherapeutic agents,
suggests that genome-wide chemosensitizer screens return molecular
components closely related to the mode of action of a particular drug.
To test this directly, we examined the consequence of target depletion
on the morphology of the mitotic spindle14. Depletion of FGD4
resulted in a significant accumulation of otherwise normal-appearing
mitotic figures in the absence of paclitaxel, indicating that this
protein may be required for support of mitotic progression
(Supplementary Fig. 4). Depletion of ACRBP and TUBGCP2,
although not detectably affecting mitosis in the absence of drug,
resulted in a marked accumulation of multipolar spindles in the
presence of 10 nM paclitaxel (Fig. 3a, and Supplementary Fig. 5b).
Multipolar spindle accumulation is typical after exposure to higher
doses of paclitaxel in H1155 cells as well as in other cancer cell
types9,11 (data not shown). Simultaneous depletion of MAD2, an
obligate component of the spindle assembly checkpoint14, reversed
the accumulation of mitotic figures with the concomitant appearance

of numerous micronucleated cells, indicating mitotic slippage
through a defective spindle assembly checkpoint (Fig. 3a). Depletion
of PSMA6, HS6ST2 and ATP6V0D2 did not affect mitotic
spindle assembly (data not shown).
Given the significant genetic heterogeneity between cancer cell
lines we next examined the effect of target depletion on a panel of
lung lines, with diverse paclitaxel IC50 values, that included the
NSCLC line HCC4017 and normal, non-malignant bronchial epithelial
line HBEC30 (ref. 15), isolated from the same individual. Out of
12 targets tested with the patient-matched tumour and normal lines,
the depletion of 4 targets selectively sensitized the tumour-derived
line to low-dose paclitaxel (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Two of the four
sensitizers were in the CT-antigen family. Three out of four CT
antigens tested also sensitized at least one additional NSCLC line to
low-dose paclitaxel with no measurable consequences on the viability
of HBEC30 cells. Not surprisingly, proteasome subunit depletion was

broadly effective in tumour cells in comparison with normal cells
(Supplementary Fig. 5a).
We also examined the effect of ACRBP or TubGCP2 depletion on
mitotic progression in these lines. Although neither ACRBP nor
TUBGCP2 depletion affected cell viability as assessed by ATP concentration
in H1299 and H2126 NSCLC cells, depletion of these
targets did enhance paclitaxel-induced mitotic arrest (Supplementary
Fig. 5b). The lack of change in viability may reflect differences in
the coupling of spindle assembly checkpoint machinery to apoptosis
in different cancer cell lines16. Consistent with this was our observation
that depleting ACRBP or TUBGCP2 sensitized H1155 cells
to paclitaxel-induced caspase activation (Supplementary Fig. 5d),
whereas in H2126 cells, depletion of ACRBP collaborated with paclitaxel
to inhibit proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 6a). In addition,
the depletion of either ACRBP or TUBGCP2 in lung-tumour-derived
cell lines lacking a robust spindle assembly checkpoint (HCC366,
HCC15 or HCC4017) was sufficient to induce the accumulation of
non-proliferating micronucleated cells, which are normally observed
after exposure to paclitaxel (Fig. 3c, and Supplementary Fig. 6b, c).
These observations highlight the emerging concept that products of
anomalous gene-expression programmes can become engaged to
buttress the fundamental biological systems required for the proliferative
fitness of cancer cells. In a specific sense, aberrant expression
of proteins such as ACRBP may contribute to mitotic progression in
cancer cells by enhancing the robustness of an otherwise weakened
mitotic spindle apparatus.
An expected outcome of genomic chemosensitizer screens is the
identification of gene products that are targets of currently available
compounds, indicating novel combinatorial therapeutic regimens.
Our isolation of the proteasome exemplifies this relationship because
collaboration between bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, and paclitaxel
has been demonstrated clinically17. Isolation of ATP6V0D2, a
subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase)18 (Table 1 and Fig. 1a),
predicts that lysosomal ATPase-inhibitors may be effective cytocidal
agents in combination with paclitaxel. Salicylihalamide A was originally
identified as an anti-tumour agent and was subsequently found to
target V-ATPase activity directly19,20. Exposure of H1155 cells to
increasing doses of a synthetic salicylihalamide derivative21, RTA 203,
together with low-dose paclitaxel revealed a significant collaborative
impact on viability at doses well below that required for the activity
of a single agent (Fig. 3d, e). This observation highlights the strong
predictive power of genome-wide synthetic-lethal screens for identification
of productive drug–drug interactions. We have used a highthroughput
functional-genomics screening platform, together with an
objective ‘hit’ selection criterion derived from probabilistic judgments
of error rates, to produce an unbiased and high-confidence
collection of the molecular components modulating chemosensitivity
in lung cancer cells. The results reveal major fulcrums of the autonomous
response of cancer cells to abrogation of microtubule dynamics; the
results also identify therapeutic targets for combinatorial chemotherapy
and highlight a major contribution of cancer-associated anomalous
gene expression patterns for support of mitotic progression in cancer
cells.

METHODS
All cells were reverse-transfected with siRNA pools complexed with
DharmaFECT reagent (optimized for each cell type). Cells were treated 48 h
after transfection and viability was assessed after an additional 48 h. For screening
data analysis, each siRNA pool was assigned a viability ratio. Viability
ratios were ranked by reproducibility between three replicates for each condition,
using a two-sample t-test followed by a Benjamini–Hochberg correction.
Immunofluorescence was performed with the use of standard fixation and permeabilization
protocols. Cells were stained with monoclonal b-tubulin antibodies,
polyclonal pericentrin antibodies, bromodeoxyuridine or antibodies against
cleaved caspase-3 followed by secondary labelling with secondary fluorescein
isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies or tetramethylrhodamine
b-isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies. Cells were observed under
a Zeiss Axioplan 2E microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu monochrome
