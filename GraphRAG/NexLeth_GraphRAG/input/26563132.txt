Key Points

• ATR inhibition is synthetically
lethal to TP53- or ATMdefective
CLL cells.
• ATR targeting induces
selective cytotoxicity and
chemosensitization in TP53-
or ATM-defective CLL cells
in vitro and in vivo.

TP53 and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) defects are associated with genomic
instability, clonal evolution, and chemoresistance in chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(CLL). Currently, therapies capable of providing durable remissions in relapsed/
refractory TP53- or ATM-defective CLL are lacking. Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-
related (ATR) mediates response to replication stress, the absence of which leads to
collapse of stalled replication forks into chromatid fragments that require resolution
through the ATM/p53 pathway. Here, using AZD6738, a novel ATR kinase inhibitor, we
investigated ATR inhibition as a synthetically lethal strategy to target CLL cells with
TP53 or ATM defects. Irrespective of TP53 or ATM status, induction of CLL cell
proliferation upregulated ATR protein, which then became activated in response to
replication stress. In TP53- or ATM-defective CLL cells, inhibition of ATR signaling
by AZD6738 led to an accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage, which was carried
through into mitosis because of defective cell cycle checkpoints, resulting in cell death by mitotic catastrophe. Consequently,
AZD6738 was selectively cytotoxic to both TP53- and ATM-defective CLL cell lines and primary cells. This was confirmed in vivo
using primary xenograft models of TP53- or ATM-defective CLL, where treatment with AZD6738 resulted in decreased tumor load
and reduction in the proportion of CLL cells with such defects. Moreover, AZD6738 sensitized TP53- or ATM-defective primary
CLL cells to chemotherapy and ibrutinib. Our findings suggest that ATR is a promising therapeutic target for TP53- or ATMdefective
CLL that warrants clinical investigation. (Blood. 2016;127(5):582-595)

Introduction

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by biological
and clinical heterogeneity.1-4 Two important genes associated with
adverse prognosis, TP53 and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM),
govern the cellular response to DNA damage, whereby CLL cells,
having accumulated sufficient genotoxic damage, are directed to
undergo cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.5,6 Disruption of these genes,
through gene deletion (ie, 17p for TP53 or 11q for ATM) and/or
mutation, confers genomic instability and chemoresistance, leading to
an adverse clinical outcome.3,7-16
There is increasing recognition that therapeutic failure and
relapse associated with chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy
can be attributed to selection of DNA damage response (DDR)–
defective subclones.17,18 As a result, a paradigm shift has emerged
toward the use of DDR-independent therapies, such as B-cell

receptor (BCR) signaling inhibitors, in CLL with TP53 defects.19,20
However, although treatment-na¨ıve del(17p) patients exhibited
durable response to the BCR signaling inhibitor ibrutinib,21
previously treated individuals with del(17p) or del(11q) continued
to demonstrate inferior progression-free and overall survival
compared with individuals without these aberrations.19,22 Furthermore,
Bruton tyrosine kinase or PLCg2 mutations,23 clonal evolution,24
early relapses, and Richter transformation25 following
ibrutinib treatment have been reported predominantly in patients
with del(17p) or del(11q). Many of these patients also acquired
complex cytogenetics,23-25 thus underscoring the relevance of
genomic instability to therapeutic resistance even for p53-
independent treatments. Patients relapsing from BCR signaling
inhibitors have limited salvage options and poor clinical outcome,

i An update to this article is included at the end
with a median survival of 3.1 months following discontinuation of
ibrutinib as reported recently by Jain et al.25 Therefore, therapeutic
strategies specifically targeting genomically unstable DDR-defective
subclones may be of value for these CLL patients.
Synthetically lethal approaches, in which collaborating pathways
that DDR-defective cells depend on for survival are exploited for
therapeutic targeting, offer a potential avenue to eradicate CLL cells
with DDR defects.26,27 In this respect, we previously demonstrated the
utility of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition as a targeted
therapy for ATM-defective CLL.28 However, synthetically lethal
approaches targeting the TP53-defective CLL phenotype have
not hitherto been investigated.
Replication stress can arise during physiological cell cycles
and is frequently elevated in malignant cells. It occurs when
replication fork progression is disrupted and cells continue
to cycle despite the presence of unreplicated DNA.29 Ataxia
telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) is a serine/threonine
protein kinase that regulates replication initiation, preventing
aberrant and excessive replication origin firing, which depletes the
cellular pool of nucleotides and replication proteins. Inhibition
of ATR therefore induces replication stress, manifested by the
accumulation of slowed and stalled replication forks with
unprotected single-stranded DNA that inevitably breaks. This
results in fragmented, partially replicated sister chromatids with
free DNA double-stranded ends (DSEs). ATR also mediates the
response to replication stress, delaying cell cycle progression, and
stabilizing and repairing DNA replication forks.29-31 If ATR is
inhibited, maintenance of genome integrity becomes dependent
on functional ATM and p53, with ATM being essential for
homologous recombination repair (HRR) to restore replication
fork topology, and both ATM and p53 for arresting cell cycle
progression to permit repair.5,6 ATR, therefore, represents an
attractive synthetically lethal target for p53 or ATM deficiency.32,33
Evidence for this synthetically lethal interaction has been previously
provided by deletion of ATR in p53-deficient mice34 and by inhibition
of ATR in tumor cell lines, which resulted in selective killing
of cells harboring p53 or ATM defects.35-37
No study to date has addressed the impact of ATR inhibition on
primary tumor samples or xenotransplantation models of hematologic
malignancies with DDR defects. Here, we used AZD6738 (AstraZeneca,
Alderley Park, United Kingdom), a novel, highly specific, and orally
bioavailable ATR kinase inhibitor to examine the effect of ATR
inhibition in primary CLL cells, cell lines, and primary CLL xenografts.
We present evidence for synthetic lethality and selective cytotoxicity in
CLL cells withTP53orATMdefects, as well as sensitization ofthese cells
to chemotherapeutic agents and ibrutinib.

Results

ATR signaling is active in proliferating CLL cells and is
inhibited by AZD6738

The ATR pathway has been shown to be suppressed in quiescent
lymphocytes.39 Consistent with this, we observed that ATR protein
expression was low in resting primary CLL cells but induced when
cells were stimulated to proliferate by coculturing with CD40 ligand
(CD40L)–expressing murine embryonic fibroblasts and interleukin
(IL) 21 (CD40L/IL-21). This was irrespective of p53 or ATM status
(Figure 1A). We used phosphorylation of checkpoint kinases Chk1 and
Chk2, which are downstream targets of ATR and ATM, respectively,
as surrogate markers for ATR and ATM pathway activation. Upon
treatment with hydroxyurea (HU), which induces replication stress,
ATR-dependent Chk1 phosphorylation was observed in proliferating
(Figure 1B, lanes 2, 3, and 10) but not quiescent (lanes 6 and 8) CLL
cells. The background Chk2 phosphorylation in quiescent cells
(lanes 5 and 6) likely reflected cellular stress when cryopreserved
samples were preincubated in culture media prior to treatment. This
was absent when fresh samples were used without preincubation
(lanes 7 and 8). As 24-hour HU treatments (lane 4) appeared to be
associated with S-phase checkpoint adaptation, a process in which
Chk1 phosphorylation is lost despite persistent replication stress,40 we
adopted 5-hour HU treatments for subsequent experiments. The
specificity of Chk1 as a marker for ATR activation was evident by
minimal Chk1 phosphorylation following ionizing radiation (IR),
which generates DNA double-strand breaks and activates the
ATM/Chk2 pathway (Figure 1C, lanes 8-11).
To investigate the effect of AZD6738 on ATR and ATM
pathways, we pretreated cycling primary CLL cells and cell lines
with 1 mM AZD6738 and/or 10 mM ATM inhibitor KU-55933
(ATMi) for 2 hours prior to HU or IR exposure. AZD6738
treatment led to suppression of ATR signaling as indicated by a
reduction in HU-induced Chk1 phosphorylation, independent of
ATM status (Figure 1C, lane 4 vs 6; Figure 1D, lanes 3 vs 4, 9 vs
10). Complete abolition of HU-induced Chk1 phosphorylation was
evident at AZD6738 doses $3 mM (supplemental Figure 4A). The
specificity of AZD6738 for ATR inhibition was demonstrated by
its lack of effect on IR-induced ATM/Chk2 phosphorylation

(Figure 1C, lane 8 vs 10; Figure 1D, lane 5 vs 6). Importantly, in
ATM-proficient primary CLL cells and cell line, AZD6738
treatment resulted in ATM activation as evidenced by ATM
phosphorylation and HU-induced Chk2 phosphorylation (Figure 1C,
lane 4 vs 6; Figure 1D, lane 3 vs 4). This indicated dependence on
the ATM pathway in the absence of functional ATR. Because DNA
protein kinase (DNA-PK) was reported to have some redundant
activity with ATR,41 we assessed the impact of DNA-PK inhibition
in primary CLL cells. We detected no change in HU-induced Chk1
phosphorylation upon treatment with DNA-PK inhibitor (supplemental
Figure 4B), suggesting that such redundancy is not present
in CLL cells.

ATR inhibition is selectively cytotoxic to TP53- or
ATM-defective CLL cells in vitro and in vivo

To assess the therapeutic potential of ATR inhibition for DDRdefective
CLL, we investigated the cytotoxic effects of AZD6738 on
CLL cells. ATM-deficient CII-ATMsh and p53-defective Mec1 cells
displayed significantly greater AZD6738 sensitivity (50% effective
concentration [EC50], 1.6 mM and 1.1 mM, respectively) following
96-hour treatment compared with ATM/p53-proficient CII-GFPsh
cells (EC50, 8.4 mM; Figure 2A). Reintroduction of wild-type TP53
significantly reduced the sensitivity of Mec1 cells to AZD6738 (EC50,

3.2 mM vs 1.0 mM; Figure 2B). The effect was, however, limited
because of a moderate level of wild-type p53 expression achieved by
transfection relative to expression of the intrinsic mutant TP53 allele
(supplemental Figure 5).
Following 96-hour AZD6738 treatment, a panel of 29 CD40L/
IL-21 cocultured primaryCLL samples provided additional evidence for
selective cytotoxicity toward CLLs with DDR defects (Figure 2C-D;
supplemental Table 1), with a significantly lower EC50 in ATMdefective
(8.7 mM; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.4-13.9 mM; n 5 6)
and TP53-defective (8.2 mM; 95% CI, 3.5-12.9 mM; n 5 6) CLL
samples compared with either ATM/TP53 wild-type CLLs (38.3 mM;
95% CI, 28.8-47.8 mM; n 5 17) or healthy donor peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs; 87.6mM; 95% CI, 50.0-125.3mM; n 5 4).
No significant difference in AZD6738 sensitivity was found when
these samples were analyzed according to clinical stage, prior
treatment, or IGHV mutational status (Figure 2E). As expected,
AZD6738 had little cytotoxic effect on cells cultured without
CD40L/IL-21, regardless of TP53 or ATM status (supplemental
Figure 6). This suggests that AZD6738 specifically targets the
proliferating CLL population.
To assess the effectiveness of ATR inhibition in vivo, we used
primary CLL xenografts. We engrafted 4 representative primary CLL
samples carrying either del(17p) and a TP53 mutation (p.I251S or
p.M237I) or del(11q) and an ATM mutation (p.I1407T or p.L3013Q)

Figure 1. ATR signaling is activated in response to replication stress in proliferating primary CLL cells and is inhibited by AZD6738. (A) Stimulation of primary CLL
cell proliferation by coculture with CD40L-expressing murine embryonic fibroblasts in the presence of IL-21 (CD40L/IL-21) for 4 days resulted in induction of ATR expression in
primary CLL cells irrespective of ATM or TP53 status. Cyclin A expression is a marker of proliferating cells. Actin is the loading control. (B) Cryopreserved or fresh primary CLL
cells cultured with or without CD40L/IL-21 (lanes 1-4 and 9 and 10, and lanes 5-8, respectively) were treated with HU. Cryopreserved samples not cocultured with CD40L/
IL-21 were resuspended and preincubated in culture media for 24 hours prior to treatment (lanes 5 and 6), whereas fresh cells were treated immediately upon isolation from
peripheral blood without preincubation (lanes 7 and 8). Exposure to HU (1 mM), which induces replication stress, led to Chk1 phosphorylation in primary CLL cells cocultured
with CD40L/IL-21 (lanes 2, 3, and 10). (C) TP53/ATM wild-type (TP53/ATM-wt) primary CLL cells cocultured with CD40L/IL-21 (C) and CII cells (D), both CII-GFPsh and
CII-ATMsh, were treated with AZD6738 (1 mM) and/or the ATM inhibitor KU-55933 (ATMi; 10 mM) for 2 hours, or left untreated, prior to exposure to HU (1 mM) or IR (6 Gy) for
a further 5 hours. AZD6738 treatment inhibited ATR signaling as indicated by a reduction in HU-induced Chk1 phosphorylation (panel C, lane 4 vs 6; panel D, lanes 3 vs 4 and
9 vs 10). In ATM-proficient CLL cells, this also led to ATM activation as evidenced by ATM phosphorylation and Chk2 phosphorylation (panel C, lane 4 vs 6; panel D, lane 3 vs
4). In panels B-C, representative blots from experiments on 3 CLL samples are shown.

into NOD/Shi-scid/IL-2Rgnullmice. Followingtreatment with AZD6738
(n 5 10) or vehicle (n 5 11) for 2 weeks, tumor load was significantly
reduced in AZD6738-treated animals compared with vehicle-treated
controls (P # .01; Figure 2F). When analyzed separately according to
genotype, both TP53- and ATM-defective AZD6738-treated xenografts
showed significant reduction in tumor load (P # .05; Figure 2G).
Furthermore, in the CLL26 xenograft where tumor cell recovery
allowed monitoring of del(11q) cells, we observed a significant reduction
inthe percentage of cells with del(11q) (37% vs 100%,P # .05)
in AZD6738-treated animals compared with vehicle-treated controls
(Figure 2H). Taken together, our in vitro and in vivo data
demonstrate efficacy and specificity of AZD6738 for TP53- or
ATM-defective CLL.

ATR inhibition induces DNA damage and mitotic catastrophe in
TP53- or ATM-defective CLL cells

Suppression of aberrant origin firing is an important mechanism
whereby ATR protects DNA replication forks from collapse.29-31 We
therefore hypothesized that ATR inhibition in CLL cells would result in
increased origin firing. To verify this, we first determined the impact of
ATR inhibition on DNA replication in CII-ATMsh and Mec1 cells by
DNA fiber analysis that visualizes origins of replication and replication
fork progression (Figure 3A-C). One hour after treatment with
AZD6738, we observed increased replication initiation as indicated
by decreased interorigin distance (Figure 3B). We also observed
decreased replication fork progression rates (Figure 3C), consistent
with fork slowing or stalling and therefore increased replication stress
upon ATR inhibition.30,31,42
We next assessed the impact of ATR inhibition on cell cycle
progression. In response to AZD6738, CII-GFPsh cells accumulated in
G0/G1 consistent with G1/S cell cycle arrest (Figure 3D; supplemental
Figure 7). In contrast, neither G1/S nor G2/M arrest was evident in
CII-ATMsh and Mec1 cells despite replication stress (Figure 3E-F;
supplemental Figure 7), indicating dependence on ATM and p53 for
cell cycle regulation in the absence of ATR. These cell cycle effects
were recapitulated in primary CLL cells upon treatment with
AZD6738, with G1/S arrest occurring in TP53/ATM wild-type but not
TP53-defective samples (Figure 3G-H).
Because ATR inhibition leads to S-phase chromatid fragments,31,32
for which effective resolution requires ATM-mediated HRR and ATM/
p53-dependent cell cycle checkpoint activation,5,6 we reasoned that
ATR inhibition should produce more fragmented chromatids in ATM/
p53-defective CLL cells. Consistent with this, we observed accumulation
of markers of DNA damage, gH2AX and 53BP1 foci, in Mec1
and ATMi pretreated CII cells but not in CII cells without ATMi
pretreatment, 24 and 48 hours, respectively, following exposure to
1 mM AZD6738 (Figure 4A-E; supplemental Figure 8). Moreover,
consistent with loss of both G1/S and G2/M checkpoints in the absence

of functional ATR and ATM/p53, Mec1 and ATMi pretreated CII cells
carrying unrepaired DNA damage progressed into mitosis, as indicated
by dual positivity for gH2AX and the mitotic marker pH3 following
24-hour incubation with 1 mM AZD6738 (Figure 4A-B).
Replication stress leads to an increase in the amount of underreplicated
regions within the genome.29 As the sister chromatids try to
separate during anaphase, these catenated regions of DNA result in
ultrafine DNA bridges, which often break and are transmitted to
daughter cells at the following G1. This can be visualized as 53BP1
nuclear bodies, which serve to protect DNA from endonuclease
degradation and facilitate repair.43,44 We observed an accumulation of
53BP1 bodies in ATM/p53-proficient CII cells following 48 hours of
AZD6738 treatment (Figure 4F). This was not seen in ATM/p53-
defective CLL cells, suggesting that formation of 53BP1 bodies was
dependent on the ATM pathway as previously demonstrated.44 Failure
to initiate this protective mechanism could precipitate further DNA
damage in ATM/p53-defective cells.
We postulated that abolition of cell cycle checkpoints because of the
combined loss of functional ATR and ATM/p53 would permit entry
into mitosis despite the accumulation of partially replicated chromatid
fragments, resulting in mitotic catastrophe. To confirm this, we probed
CLL cells for pH3 and lamin B. Cells undergoing normal mitosis stain
positive for pH3 but lose lamin B staining. In contrast, cells undergoing
mitotic catastrophe do not stain for pH3 but retain lamin B staining,
whereas expression of both markers is lost when cells undergo apoptosis
(Figure 4G). We found significant levels of mitotic catastrophe
72 hours following 1 mM AZD6738 in Mec1 and ATMi pretreated CII
cells, but not in CII cells without ATMi pretreatment (Figure 4H).
Because of incomplete DNA replication in the presence of AZD6738,
we did not observe accumulation of tetraploid cells (G2/M population)
that can accompany mitotic catastrophe (Figure 3E-F,H).45
In ATM/p53-proficient CII cells, we detected low-level apoptotic
activity with AZD6738, which is likely a result of p53 activation in
responseto replication stress (supplemental Figure 9A-B).Mec1 cells also
exhibited low levels of apoptotic markers poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
and caspase cleavage (supplemental Figure 9C), but such levels were
unlikely to account for their differential sensitivity to ATR inhibition
compared with DDR-proficient cells. Indeed, the negligible impact of
pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK on the viability of AZD6738-treated
Mec1 cells supports this notion (supplemental Figure 9D).

ATR inhibition sensitizes TP53- or ATM-defective CLL cells to
chemotherapy and ibrutinib

We reasoned that the synthetically lethal effects of ATR inhibition on
ATM- orTP53-defective CLL cells could sensitizethese chemoresistant
cells to chemotherapeutic agents through potentiation of DNA damage.
We therefore assessed the impact of combining AZD6738 with
chemotherapy in CII-ATMsh and Mec1 cells. Although resistance to

Figure 2 (continued) fluorescence intensity as shown in supplemental Figure 2. Surviving fraction is expressed relative to untreated controls. AZD6738 induced significantly
greater dose-dependent cytotoxicity in ATM/TP53-defective CLL cells than either ATM/TP53 wild-type CLL cells or healthy donor PBMCs. (D) The EC50 of AZD6738 was
significantly lower for ATM/TP53-defective primary CLL samples than both ATM/TP53 wild-type samples and healthy donor PBMCs. A list of CLL samples assessed and their
respective EC50 values are provided in supplemental Table 1. (E) There was no significant difference in the EC50 of AZD6738 between subgroups of CLL samples stratified
according to Binet stage, prior treatment, and IGHV mutational status. (F) Primary CLL samples (CLL29, CLL31, CLL25, CLL26) with biallelic TP53 or ATM defects were
engrafted into NOD/Shi-scid/IL-2Rgnull mice and treated with vehicle (n 5 11) or AZD6738 (n 5 10). Collectively, AZD6738 treatment significantly reduced tumor load
compared with vehicle treatment in TP53/ATM-defective xenografts. (G) When analyzed separately, both TP53 and ATM defective xenografts showed significant reduction in
tumor load following AZD6738 treatment compared with vehicle-treated controls. (H) Fluorescence in situ hybridization probes for 11q were applied on human CD451 CD191
cells collected from the spleens of CLL26 xenografts (harboring del(11q) and L3013Q ATM mutation) treated with AZD6738 (n 5 3) or vehicle (n 5 3). Two hundred cells were
analyzed per mouse. The proportion of CLL cells with del(11q) was significantly reduced following AZD6738 treatment compared with vehicle-treated controls. All data are
displayed as mean 6 standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical significance was determined using 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni post hoc analysis

chlorambucil, fludarabine, 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide, or bendamustine
monotherapy was evident even at relatively high doses, we
discovered significant sensitization to a range of doses of these agents
upon addition of 1 mM AZD6738 (Figure 5; Table 1). Of note,
CII-GFPsh cells were sensitive to chemotherapy. However, addition

of AZD6738 to chemotherapeutic agents led to further sensitization
(supplemental Figure 10; supplemental Table 2).
We then proceeded to evaluate these findings in DDR-defective
primary CLL cells cocultured with CD40L/IL-21. AZD6738

the coculture system, the sensitization effect (Figure 6A-B) was less
profound than in CLL cell lines (Figure 5A-B). Interestingly, in these
primary CLL samples, we also found additive to synergistic interaction

between AZD6738 and cytotoxic doses of ibrutinib46 (Figure 6C-D;
Table 2). We addressed mechanisms behind the AZD6738-ibrutinib
interaction. We discovered modest dose-dependent reduction in Erk/Syk
phosphorylation with AZD6738 and dose-dependent reduction in
HU-induced Chk1 phosphorylation with ibrutinib (supplemental
Figure 11), suggesting that off-target effects of AZD6738 and ibrutinib
may account for the potentiating effect at higher dose combinations
involving 4 mM or 16 mM ibrutinib. We also observed that whereas
AZD6738 primarily targeted cycling CLL cells for killing, ibrutinib
affected both the cycling and noncycling populations (supplemental
Figure 12). This could potentially account for the sensitization seen
with 1 mM ibrutinib.
Finally, we assessed the AZD6738-chlorambucil combination in a
primary xenograft model with del(11q) and ATM mutation p.I407T.
Twenty engrafted mice were treated with AZD6738, chlorambucil, the
AZD6738-chlorambucil combination, or vehicle (n 5 5 in each arm).
AZD6738 monotherapy resulted in significant reduction in tumor load.
Moreover, combination treatment yielded significantly greater reductions
in tumor load than chlorambucil monotherapy (Figure 6E-F),
although synergism could not be appropriately assessed from this
experiment. Collectively, our results support the combined use of ATR
inhibitor with a range of existing therapeutic agents for CLL.

Discussion

In this study, we presented in vitro and in vivo data demonstrating
efficacy of ATR inhibition in CLL with TP53 or ATM defects. This
report is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of a therapeutic
approach that provides specific targeting of TP53-defective CLL cells.
Our findings offer insight into the cytotoxic mechanism underpinning
ATR inhibition in CLL, which is consistent with our current
understanding of the role of ATR in resolving replication stress
(Figure 7A).29-33,47-50 When ATR function is abolished, stalled
replication forks with persistent single-stranded DNA are susceptible
to nicking and collapse resulting in a partially replicated sister

chromatid with a DSE that has become disengaged from the replication
template (Figure 7B). Reengagement of the DSE with the replication
template requires the HRR stimulatory activity of ATM. Similarly,
functional p53 becomes required in the context of ATR inhibition for
cell cycle arrest to permit repair of collapsed forks and HRR-directed
reengagement of DSEs to restore replication fork geometry
(Figure 7C). In the absence of HRR, nonhomologous end joining can
ligate 2 independently generated partially replicated sister chromatid
DSEs, at the expense of potential sequence deletions and aberrant
chromosomal translocations. CLL cells with defective p53 or ATM
accumulate collapsed forks and DSEs, whereupon lack of effective cell
cycle regulation permits subsequent unrestricted entry into mitosis,
resulting in mitotic catastrophe (Figure 7D).
This mechanistic model accounts for the selective cytotoxicity of
ATR inhibition for CLL cells with TP53 or ATM defects. Importantly,
ATR inhibition is capable of circumventing the protective effect of
the microenvironment, which often hinders effective clearance of
genomically unstable, proliferating CLL populations. This is evidenced
by the ability of AZD6738 to overcome the prosurvival signals
provided by the CD40L/IL-21 coculture system that mimics interaction
of CLL cells with T cells in proliferation centers and, in xenograft
experiments, by the loss of tumor burden in murine spleens upon
treatment with AZD6738.
Interestingly, whereas TP53- or ATM-defective primary CLL
samples were uniformly and substantially more sensitive to ATR
inhibition than healthy donor PBMCs, TP53/ATM wild-type primary
CLL cells displayed variable sensitivity toward ATR inhibition. There
are several potential explanations for this finding. Firstly the acquisition
of additional, as yet uncharacterized DDR defects could render some
CLL patients sensitive to ATR inhibition even in the absence of
defective TP53 or ATM. Secondly, such variability in sensitivity could
be because of different amounts of endogenous DNA damage in each
sample, reflecting varying degrees of genomic instability. ATR
inhibition may therefore potentially be most useful in heavily pretreated
relapsed/refractory patients, where higher levels of genomic instability
could be attributable, in part, to enhanced replication stress. Finally,
alternative lengthening of telomeres has been reported in CLL cells51

Figure 6. ATR inhibition synergizes with existing therapeutic agents both in ATM-defective and TP53-defective primary CLL cells. CFSE-labeled primary CLL cells
with ATM defect (CLL22, CLL23, CLL24) (A) or TP53 defect (CLL29, CLL31, CLL32) (B) cocultured with CD40L/IL-21 were treated with chlorambucil, fludarabine, 4HC, or
ibrutinib with or without coadministration of AZD6738 (1 mM). Viability was assessed after 96 hours by propidium iodide exclusion of the proliferating cell population as
identified by reduction in CFSE fluorescence intensity. Surviving fraction is expressed relative to untreated controls for chemotherapy treatment alone (no AZD6738) and
relative to 1 mM AZD6738 monotherapy for the cotreated samples. Addition of AZD6738 significantly enhanced sensitivity of ATM-defective primary CLL samples to

and could provide an additional mechanism accounting for their
sensitivity to ATR inhibition.52 Further work is required to explore
these hypotheses and identify markers of sensitivity to ATR inhibition
in CLL other than TP53 or ATM defects. With respect to TP53 or ATM
defects, the specificity of ATR inhibition for these lesions could allow
alteration of the subclonal landscape in favor of less genomically
unstable DDR-proficient subclones, which are less susceptible to clonal
evolution, thus reducing the likelihood of therapeutic resistance or
disease relapse. The specificity of ATR inhibition for TP53-defective
CLL cells may possibly also reduce the likelihood of Richter
transformation because TP53 defects have been implicated in this
process.53,54
Inhibitors of ATR such as AZD6738 could therefore potentially
augment current therapies for TP53- or ATM-defective CLL. This is
likely to be attributable to potentiation by chemotherapeutic agents of
AZD6738-induced replication stress to which TP53- or ATM-defective
cells are distinctively susceptible. In CLL, deep remissions attained
with chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy are translatable into longterm
treatment-free survival.55,56 Hence, combination of ATR inhibitor
with cytotoxic chemotherapy could provide a realistic salvage option
for TP53- or ATM-defective patients relapsing from signaling
inhibitors. The synergism of AZD6738 with chlorambucil and
bendamustine is particularly attractive given their milder toxicity
profiles, making these combinations potentially suitable for older or
frailer CLL patients. Although the in vivo toxicity profile and long-term
effects of AZD6738 remain to be established in a clinical setting, it is
important to note the lack of detrimental effect on normal tissues
reported in mice subjected to ATR suppression to 10% of its normal
levels.57Corroborating this report, the AZD6738 dose used in our study
to achieve effective tumor load reduction in TP53/ATM-defective
xenografts was well tolerated. In addition, the discrepancy between
sensitivity of TP53/ATM-defective CLL cells and healthy donor

PBMCs to AZD6738 argues for the existence of a substantial
therapeutic window making it suitable for clinical use. A potential
caveat is that the prolonged use of the ATR inhibitor could allow
accumulation of postreplicative damage in nontumor cells as well as
ATM/p53 wild-type CLL cells.58 Hence, our current data support the
use of ATR inhibition specifically in CLL patients with TP53 or ATM
defects, where there is distinct reliance on ATR and sensitivity to ATR
inhibition.
Unexpectedly, we found, depending on the dose, additivity or
synergism between AZD6738 and ibrutinib in DDR-defective primary
CLL cells. The underlying mechanism of the potentiating interaction at
higher dose combinations may involve off-target effects of AZD6738
and ibrutinib. At clinically relevant doses (with #1 mM ibrutinib),
however, this is likely to be accounted for by the limited overlap in the
cellular populations that are targeted by these 2 compounds. Should
AZD6738 be used in combination with BCR signaling inhibitors,
consideration needs to be given to the sequence of treatment because
signaling inhibitors, which evict CLL cells from proliferation centers,
may render them quiescent and no longer sensitive to ATR inhibition.19
In patients with TP53/ATM-defective CLL, we envisage daily administration
of AZD6738 until the attainment of maximum response.
Given the relatively high CLL proliferation rate associated with clinically
aggressive, relapsed/refractory disease,59 andthe potent cytotoxic
effect of AZD6738 against proliferating TP53/ATM-defective CLL
cells, we anticipate that this could be profound and achievable over
weeks to months. Combination with chemotherapy or other targeted
therapies would allow simultaneous targeting of both the proliferating
and nonproliferating populations, and both DDR proficient and
deficient subclones. When combined with ibrutinib, AZD6738 should
be initiated first, with ibrutinib added subsequently and dual therapy
continued until maximum response is attained.

combination with chlorambucil significantly reduced tumor load relative to vehicle, and the addition of AZD6738 to chlorambucil led to a significantly greater reduction in tumor
load relative to chlorambucil monotherapy. The relative number of CLL cells in panel F was normalized to vehicle-treated controls. Data are displayed as mean 6 SEM.

Finally, TP53 andATM defects are poor prognostic markers in other
hematologic malignancies including mantle cell lymphoma,60
T-prolymphocytic leukemia,61,62 acute myeloid leukemia,63,64 myelodysplastic
syndrome,65 multiple myeloma,66,67 and diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma.68 Our work on CLL provides a model of how ATR

inhibition could selectively target TP53- or ATM-defective cells, and its
use in these malignancies could be explored in future studies.
In conclusion, ATR inhibition allows selective targeting of
genomically unstable DDR-defective CLL cells, therefore potentially
helping to avert clonal evolution, a major cause of treatment

Figure 7. A model for synthetic lethality
in CLL cells with ATM or p53 deficiency
by inhibition of ATR. ATM and ATR are
master regulators of DDR, with ATM being
activated in response to DNA double-strand
breaks, and ATR in response to replication
stress. (A) Activation of the ATR pathway
leads to cell cycle arrest mediated primarily
through the G2/M checkpoint and repair of
stalled replication forks. This leads to the
resolution of replication stress. (B-C) Inhibition
of ATR by AZD6738 directly induces
replication stress by slowing and stalling
replication forks. The inability of CLL cells
to resolve stalled forks as a result of suppressed
ATR signaling leads to collapse of
stalled replication forks into fragmented,
partially replicated sister chromatids with
free DNA DSEs that necessitate repair
through the ATM/p53 pathway. This involves
cell cycle arrest mediated primarily through
the G1/S checkpoint and HRR. (D) In cells
with defective ATM or p53, inhibition of ATR
by AZD6738 results in an intolerable accumulation
of unrepaired DNA damage. This
arises from impaired HRR because of defective
ATM and/or impaired cell cycle regulation
