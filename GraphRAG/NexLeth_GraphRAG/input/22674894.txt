Abstract
Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and the transformation related protein 53 (Trp53) are potent regulators of cell growth and metabolism in development and cancer.
In vitro
evidence suggests several mechanistic pathway interactions. Here, we tested whether loss of function of p53 leads to IGF2 ligand pathway dependency
in vivo
. Developmental lethality occurred in
p53
homozygote null mice that lacked the paternal expressed allele of imprinted
Igf2
. Further lethality due to post-natal lung haemorrhage occurred in female progeny with
Igf2
paternal null allele only if derived from double heterozygote null fathers, and was associated with a specific gene expression signature. Conditional deletion of
Igf2
fl/fl
attenuated the rapid tumour onset promoted by homozygous deletion of
p53
fl/fl
. Accelerated carcinoma and sarcoma tumour formation in
p53
+/−
females with bi-allelic
Igf2
expression was associated with reductions in
p53
loss of heterozygosity and apoptosis.
Igf2
genetic dependency of the
p53
null phenotype during development and tumour formation suggests that targeting the IGF2 pathway may be useful in the prevention and treatment of human tumours with a disrupted Trp53 pathway.

The tumour suppressor gene
p53
, expressed throughout development and adult life, is frequently disrupted in human cancers (Olivier et al,
2002
). DNA damage, oncogene activation, telomere erosion, nucleotide depletion and hypoxia, can activate p53 cellular responses including cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence and DNA repair (Menendez et al,
2009
; Riley et al,
2008
; Vousden & Prives,
2009
). Degradation of transformation related protein (Trp53) is mediated primarily by the human double minute 2 (MDM2/4) ubiquitin E3 ligase which is itself a transcriptional target of Trp53 (Marine & Lozano,
2010
). Individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) develop early onset cancers, and in 30–50% of cases, the tumours are attributed to germ-line heterozygote mutation of
p53
with associated loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the wild-type (WT) allele (Malkin,
2011
; Srivastava et al,
1990
). Modifiers alter the age of tumour onset in LFS. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the MDM2 (SNP 309) gene promoter regulates the relative expression level of this negative regulator of p53 (Bond et al,
2004
). SNP 309 associated gain of function of
MDM2/4
expression renders p53 functionally null, and reduces the age of tumour onset in LFS by 7–15 years (Bond et al,
2004
). A modifier in
p53
itself (Trp53 codon 72) also reduces the age of tumour onset, but is more modest at 2–3 years (Fang et al,
2010
). Screening of LFS patients for early onset tumours significantly impacts overall survival, such that identification of pathway modifiers of lethal tumour phenotypes have implications for both screening and prevention therapies (Villani et al,
2011
).
Mice with homozygous disruption of
p53
(
p53
−/−
) are viable except for an exencephalic phenotype in females (Armstrong et al,
1995
; Clarke et al,
1993
; Donehower et al,
1992
). Homozygote animals die within 6 months, due mainly to thymic lymphoma.
p53
heterozygosity markedly reduces lymphoma, sarcoma and epithelial tumour latency and mirrors the phenotype of LFS (Donehower et al,
1992
; Jacks et al,
1994
). Increased
p53
expression and conditional restoration of
p53
function resulted in reduced tumour frequency, senescence and tumour regression (Martins et al,
2006
; Ventura et al,
2007
; Xue et al,
2007
).
p53
is frequently mutated at specific ‘hotspot’ bases in tumours. Mutations can lead to gain of function, as
p53
R172H/+
and
p53
R270H/+
can increase in carcinomas and osteosarcoma in the former, and carcinoma metastasis in the latter (Lang et al,
2004
; Olive et al,
2004
). Modelling of
Mdm2
SNP alleles (SNP 309G of
MDM2
) in the mouse has validated effects on tumour latency (Post et al,
2010
). Stabilization of mutant p53 is also required in tumours, and is frequently associated with aggressive tumour phenotypes that can be induced by similar modifiers to those that regulate WT p53 (Suh et al,
2011
). Thus modelling potential pathway modifiers of
p53
loss and gain of function are important intermediary steps in the validation of clinically important pathway targets for tumour treatment.
Evidence
in vitro
suggests convergence between IGF-PI3K-AKT-mTOR and ARF-MDM2-p53 pathways, mainly through promotion of IGF-PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway activation following loss of p53 function. Interactions include; phosphorylation of MDM2 by Akt (Feng et al,
2004
; Mayo & Donner,
2001
), transcription of the ligand
IGF2
(Lee et al,
2000
; Zhang et al,
1996
,
1998
) and regulation of the insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (
IGF1R
; Ungewitter & Scrable,
2010
; Werner et al,
1996
). Insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBP-2, -3 and -7) are negative regulators of IGF bio-availability and are also p53 target genes (Buckbinder et al,
1995
; Grimberg et al,
2006
; Suzuki et al,
2010
). Function of p53 may be mediated by Phlda3, a negative regulator of Akt (Brady et al,
2011
), and via activation of PTEN (Stambolic et al,
2001
), TSC2, AMP1 (Feng et al,
2007
), sestrins 1 and 2 (Budanov & Karin,
2008
) or REDD1 (Ellisen et al,
2002
).
IGF2
mRNA over-expression increases ligand supply in common human cancers mainly due to loss of imprinting (LOI, bi-allelic expression; Foulstone et al,
2005
; Ito et al,
2008
). Binding of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) to IGF1R and isoform A of the insulin receptor (IR-A) transmits downstream signalling via IRS1 and IRS2 to both the PI3K-AKT-mTOR and RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathways (Chalhoub & Baker,
2009
; Ulanet et al,
2010
). Supply of IGF2 is also controlled via its sequestration by the mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor receptor 2 (
Igf2r
; Foulstone et al,
2005
; Ghosh et al,
2003
; Zaccheo et al,
2006
).
Igf2
expression is imprinted (maternal allele silenced) in the mouse, leading to paternal allele expression that is also highly regulated during embryonic and post-natal development (Baker et al,
1993
). Targeted disruption of the paternal (p) allele of
Igf2
(
Igf2
+m/−p
) regulates whole organism growth (60% of the size of WT littermates; Burns & Hassan,
2001
; DeChiara et al,
1990
,
1991
). Maternal (m) disruption of the imprinting control region (ICR) and the
H19
gene (
H19
Δ13kb/+
p
) subsequently referred to as
H19
−m/+p
, results in bi-allelic
Igf2
expression and an overgrowth phenotype of 128% of the size of
WT
littermates (Leighton et al,
1995
). Importantly, the
H19
−m/+p
growth phenotype was rescued by
Igf2
+m/−p
, suggesting that the predominate growth effects were mediated by
Igf2
, rather than as a consequence of the disruption of either the maternal allele locus,
H19
non-coding RNA or the associated miR-675 (Gabory et al,
2009
; Veronese et al,
2010
; Yoshimizu et al,
2008
).
Igf2
can be reactivated in mouse tumours by LOI, where it promotes tumour progression (Christofori et al,
1994
,
1995
). DNA hypomethylation also results in increased
Igf2
expression and tumour promotion (Gaudet et al,
2003
; Linhart et al,
2007
). Here we provide
in vivo
evidence of significant
Igf2
dependency of the
p53
null phenotype during development and tumour formation.RESULTS
Igf2
-dependent developmental lethality of
p53
null mice
Mice with varying allelic doses of
Igf2
and
p53
were combined.
Igf2
+m/−p
are deficient in
Igf2
expression because of disruption of the expressed paternal allele associated with silencing (imprinting) of the maternal allele.
H19
−m/+p
over-express
Igf2
because of disruption of imprinting of the maternal allele ICR leading to bi-allelic expression (p, paternal allele; m, maternal allele; +, intact allele; −, disrupted allele). These lines were first crossed with heterozygote
p53
+/−
mice. The double heterozygote (e.g.
Igf2
+m/−p
,
p53
+/−
or
H19
−m/+p
,
p53
+/−
) progeny were subsequently inter-crossed to generate combined genotypes including double homozygote alleles. As there are known strain-dependent phenotypic effects in
p53
null mice (Harvey et al,
1993
), we utilized both the 129S2/J (129) and C57BL/6J (B6) genetic backgrounds backcrossed by >20 generations. We were unable to backcross
Igf2
+m/−p
onto a B6 background, and so 129/B6 F2 hybrids were generated (see Supporting Information
Table S1
).
The initial observation was that litter sizes from the 129 double heterozygote inter-cross (
Igf2
+m/−p
,
p53
+/−
×
Igf2
+m/−p
,
p53
+/−
) appeared significantly smaller, suggesting there was an overall loss of progeny (
Fig 1A
). This was only observed when breeding from double heterozygote mothers (
Igf2
+m/−p
,
p53
+/−
, Supporting Information
Fig S1A and B
) and appeared independent of the parental
Igf2
dose (Supporting Information
Fig S2
). The majority of implantation sites in double heterozygote (
Igf2
+m/−p
,
p53
+/−
) mothers appeared abnormal (Supporting Information
Fig S1C
). Haemorrhage was observed within the maternal decidua at implantation sites in double heterozygote (
Igf2
+m/−p
,
p53
+/−
) mothers, and was less frequently observed in either
p53
+/−
or
Igf2
+m/−p
heterozygote mothers (Supporting Information
Fig S1C and D
).

mice were significantly greater (***
p

Igf2
+m/−p
and
Igf2

mice regardless of allelic dosage of
p53
.
Increased post-natal mortality by p30 in progeny null for both

Igf2
−m/−p
,
p53
−/−
, 5 of 9) relative to
WT
mice (1 of 15,
p
= 0.037, Fisher's exact test).
At birth, either
H19
−m/+p
,
Igf2
+m/−p
or
p53
+/−
alleles exhibited the expected Mendelian segregation (129, B6 and F1/F2, Supporting Information
Tables S2 and S3
). The exception, however, were the results from a 129 double heterozygote null inter-cross (e.g.
Igf2
+m/−p
,
p53
+/−
×
Igf2
+m/−p
×
p53

;
Table 1
). Evaluation of 297 mice from 34 litters led to three further observations.

Progeny did not segregate according to a normal Mendelian distribution (
p
< 0.02,
χ
2
-test). In contrast, progeny from the 129B6F1
Igf2
+/−
,
p53
+/−
inter-cross had a normal Mendelian distribution. Observed (upper), expected (middle, in brackets) and
χ

(lower).
First, genotypes associated with loss of function of the paternal expressed
Igf2
allele were 60% smaller from birth (
Fig 1B
). Second, pre-natal and post-natal lethality occurred in homozygote null
p53
combined with disruption of the paternal expressed allele of
Igf2
(
Igf2
+m/−p
,
p53
−/−
and
Igf2
−m/−p
,
p53
−/−
mice). The lethality was observed by birth (16 of 44 expected), but also continued during the post-natal period and was associated with no obvious developmental abnormalities (
Fig 1C
). Third, there was specific absence of
Igf2
+m/−p
female progeny. Post-natal (P3.5) loss of
Igf2
+m/−p
in both sexes was expected based on steroid responsive delayed lung development (
Table 1
; Silva et al,
2006
). However, a deficit specific to females occurred in our case (
Fig 2A
and
Table 2
). If double heterozygote (
Igf2
+m/−p
,
p53
+/−
) males were crossed with either WT or
p53
+/−
females (
Table 2
), we again failed to obtain any live
Igf2
+m/−p
females. Thus, combined loss of alleles for both
p53
and
Igf2
in the paternal germ-line appeared incompatible with specific survival of subsequent
Igf2
+m/−p
,
p53
+/+
female progeny. In contrast, double heterozygote (
Igf2
+m/−p
,
p53
+/−
) female littermates survived beyond post-natal day 10, indicating the lethality could be rescued by loss of an allele of
p53
. Morphological appearances of embryos appeared normal between E9.5 and E18.5, even though
Igf2
+m/−p
embryos were smaller (Supporting Information
Fig S3
). Following delivery by caesarean section at E19.5,
Igf2
+m/−p
females became increasingly cyanotic (
Fig 2B
). Analysis of organ growth revealed that the mean wet weights of lungs from
Igf2
+m/−p
females were significantly reduced compared either to
WT
,
Igf2
+m/−p
males or double heterozygote females (
Igf2
+m/−p
,
p53
+/−
,
Fig 2C
and Supporting Information

Significant deviation from the normal expected Mendelian ratio of
Igf2
+m/−p
progeny from
WT
mothers at P3.5 in both females and males was detected, suggesting an effect of the paternal allele on survival. The

genotyped progeny derived from

p53

males were absent at P10 compared to E18.5, although the significance was not detected in the segregation of genotypes in progeny derived from
p53

,
Igf2
+m/−p
or double heterozygote (
Igf2
+m/−p
,
p53

WT
and
Igf2
+m/−p
embryos are of similar size at E9.5, and we wished to eliminate confounding effects from later differences in growth (Burns & Hassan,
2001
). Illumina RNA expression profiles of all female progeny at E9.5 were then compared (
Fig 3B
). A specific gene expression signature was observed in progeny that were derived from double heterozygote fathers (
Igf2
+m/−p
,
p53
+/−
;
Fig 3B
). Greater than two-fold differences in gene expression were observed for 1461 genes (
Fig 3B
lists the most differentially expressed genes) with the top 50 differentially expressed genes further annotated (
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-1001
; note all microarray data and tables of genes described are available from Arrayexpress). Importantly, no effects were consistent with co-segregation of the gene expression signature with the
p53
null allele, suggesting the signature was a direct consequence of the combined paternal genotype rather than a segregating modifier allele. By filtering the initial signature of 1461 genes according to chromosomal location, we obtained 53 X-linked genes. These genes were distributed along the entire length of the X-chromosome and failed to show any differential expression patterns (data not shown).

Igf2

female embryos (low power above, bar 1 mm, high power 100 µm) were filled with blood in both bronchioles (br) alveolar air-spaces (alv) when compared to WT littermates. Confocal images showed there were no gross differences in lung structure labelled with E-cadherin, but fibronectin was predominantly present in blood within the airspaces (white arrow), and subjectively increased in small airway and alveolar regions (white arrow head). Bar = 100 µm.
We evaluated whether the gene lethality expression profiles represented a hierarchy of transcriptional regulation.
PScan
(Zambelli et al,
2009
) determined transcription factors whose binding sites were statistically over-represented in the 50 most differentially expressed genes, including those located on the X-chromosome. A single X-linked transcription factor,
Zfx
, was a regulator of the gene sets, although there were no differences in
Zfx
mRNA levels (not shown; Cellot & Sauvageau,
2007
; Luoh et al,
1997
). We also identified
Igf2
-dependent genes in all females, with respect to the paternal genotype. A total of 41
Igf2
-dependent genes, including
Igf2
itself, were obtained from this further analysis, with some apparent fold change differences dependent on paternal
p53
+/−
status, suggesting that
Igf2
regulated genes may also be differentially modified by
p53
. Using
PScan
(Zambelli et al,
2009
) to locate putative p53 binding sites in the promoters of the 50 most differentially expressed genes between progeny that were derived from double heterozygote fathers (
Igf2
+m/−p
,
p53
+/−
) and controls, we detected 48/50 potential p53 regulated genes. These were located in autosomes, without overlap with
Igf2
regulated genes.
We next focused on the
p53-
dependent rescue of lethality in
Igf2
+m/−p
females. We reasoned that genes responsible for lethality would be differentially expressed in
Igf2
+m/−p
female progeny of double heterozygote fathers (
Igf2
+m/−p
,
p53
+/−
), relative to the
Igf2
+m/−p
,
p53
+/−
female littermates that survive. The expression levels of the lethality rescue genes would be expected to be closer to those in
Igf2
+m/−p
embryos from
Igf2
+m/−p
or WT fathers, i.e. that expression was normalized. The genes identified as significantly different in
Igf2
+m/−p
females compared to
Igf2
+m/−p
and
Igf2
+m/−p
,
p53
+/−
embryos female littermates were then compared (
Fig 3C
). We obtained a signature that most likely represented the gene changes associated with
p53
+/−
rescue. The E9.5 ‘lethality (rescue) signature’ (
Fig 3C
) contained 23 genes including those encoding transcription factors (
Zmiz2
,
Tbx6
), endocrine regulators (
Sst
), endocytosis (
Necap2
), metabolic enzymes (
Pck2
,
Man1a
,
Pus7
) and the extracellular matrix protein, fibronectin (
Fn1
).
We noted that the relative expression levels of
Fn1
were high compared to the other genes (
Fig 3C
). Previous work had identified
Fn1
gain of function as a modifier of lung branching morphogenesis, associated with gain of cell–matrix adhesion relative to the reciprocal repression of E-cadherin cell–cell adherence (Sakai et al,
2003
). Lung airspaces of the
Igf2
+m/−p
,
p53
+/+
females were filled with blood suggesting that haemorrhage was the likely cause of death (
Fig 3D
). Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) detected no obvious gross structural alterations in vessels and airways, neither in E-cadherin, Ki67 nor cleaved caspase-3 labelling (
Fig 3D
and not shown). Localization of fibronectin showed increased labelling in blood present in both large and small airways, presumably related to its known role in coagulation. However, an increase in fibronectin appeared in regions of the small airways and alveoli in
Igf2
+m/−p
,
p53
+/+
females compared to female and male WT and
Igf2
+m/−p
,
p53
+/−
littermates (
Fig 3D
and not shown).
Accelerated tumour formation in
p53
heterozygote females combined with loss of imprinting of
Igf2
(
H19
−m/+p
)
We next investigated dependencies of the
p53
and
Igf2
pathways during tumour development. Neither allelic loss nor gain of
Igf2
expression in WT (
p53
+/+
) and homozygote null (
p53
−/−
) mice had any effect on tumour latency and overall longevity to 18 months, even though the IGF and p53 pathways were both implicated in aging and longevity in the mouse (Donehower,
2002
,
2009
; Supporting Information
Fig S4
). Heterozygosity of
p53
(
p53
+/−
) combined with bi-allelic expression of
Igf2
(in this case associated with the 13 kb deletion of the
H19
gene and ICR
H19
Δ13kb
), resulted in accelerated tumour formation in B6, 129 or F2 backgrounds (
Fig 4A–C
). Interestingly, the effect on tumour progression also appeared unusually specific to females rather than males (
Fig 4D
). Control
p53
+/−
females and males had similar tumour latencies (
Fig 4D
) indicating that the acceleration in tumour formation in females was primarily due to the consequences of Δ13 kb deletion on the
Igf2-H19
locus. The consequences of
H19
−m/+p
include the expected bi-allelic expression of
Igf2
, loss of function of the
H19 ncRNA
and associated miR-675, and the potential up-regulation of miR-483 in the
Igf2
locus (Gabory et al,
2009
).

A statistically significant alteration in tumour spectrum occurred in
p53
+/−
mice with
H19
−m/+p
, with more tumours classified as carcinoma and sarcoma compared to
p53
+/−
mice (
Fig 4E
, Supporting Information
Fig S5
). Inactivation of the remaining WT
p53
allele by LOH is normally required for tumour formation. We next determined the frequency of
p53
LOH, mutation and the presence of p53 protein by IHC in tumours and correlated this with latency and tumour spectrum in
H19
−m/+p
,
p53
+/−
(
Fig 5A
; Supporting Information
Table S4
). Overall, 70% (21/30) of tumours from
p53
+/−
littermates had either LOH or mutation of
p53
compared to 16.7% (2/12) of tumours in
H19
−m/+p
,
p53
+/−
(
Fig 5A
). In carcinomas and sarcomas, and to a lesser extent in lymphoma,
p53
LOH frequency appeared independent of loss of the paternal
Igf2
allele (
Fig 5B
). In contrast, the untargeted (intact)
p53
allele was retained in sarcoma and carcinomas associated with bi-allelic expression of
Igf2
(
Fig 5B
), although this was independent of sex (not shown). High
Igf2
expression determined by quantitative PCR was particularly associated with an intact p53 allele in sarcomas that arose in
H19
−m/+p
,
p53
+/−
mice, but was without consistent differences in Mdm2 localization (Supporting Information
Figs S6 and S7
).
p53
LOH was detected with equal frequency to intact alleles in all tumours with lower
Igf2
expression (
Fig 5C
, Supporting Information
Fig S7
). For the tumours that arose in
H19
−m/+p
,
p53
+/−
, we detected 1/10 with mutations in the p53 DNA-binding domain (Supporting Information
Table S4
). Our data suggested that bi-allelic expression of
Igf2
and the associated disruption of the
H19
locus may have reduced the selection pressure for inactivation of the remaining WT allele of
p53
mainly in carcinoma and sarcoma.

To determine whether proliferation and apoptosis were modified in the accelerated tumour formation from bi-allelic
H19
−m/+p
,
p53
+/−
females, we performed immuno-labelling for Ki67 proliferative marker and cleaved caspase-3 apoptotic marker. In contrast to Ki67 labelling, cleaved caspase-3 labelling was significantly reduced in solid tumours (carcinoma and sarcoma) from
p53
+/−
mice when combined with bi-allelic
Igf2
expression compared to tumours from mice with mono-allelic
Igf2
expression (
Fig 5D
). The correlation of cleaved caspase 3 labelling with
Igf2
expression approached significance (Supporting Information
Fig S8
). The cause of the sex-specific acceleration of tumour development in females still remains obscure. The effect may be either paternal or X-linked, as oestrogen receptor (ER-α) immuno-labelling appeared independent of sex, tumour histology or genotype (Supporting Information
Fig S9
).

dependency of the rapid tumour onset in
p53
null using combined conditional alleles
We next utilized a new conditional allele for
Igf2
with loxp sites that flanked either side of exons 4–6 (Sandovici et al, in preparation), a conditional allele previously characterized for
p53
, and combined these with a conditional tamoxifen inducible Cre (ROSA26Cre; see Supporting Information
Table S5
).

males on a C57BL6-FVBN background (
Fig 6A
). Injection of tamoxifen (1 mg) to mothers at E10.5 generated deletion alleles and the expected segregation of progeny (37 males and 28 females, Supporting Information
Fig S10A
). Non-quantitative PCR suggested that recombination was incomplete as most tissues retained the loxp flanked allele (Supporting Information
Fig S10B
). We were unable to either conditionally modify both alleles prior to embryonic day 8, or to generate germ-line transmission of deleted alleles. Continued breeding of males with
p53
loxp flanked alleles resulted in 73 mice from 5.6 litters with normal transmission of non-recombined alleles. Following recombination
in utero
, males with deleted alleles (
p53
Δ/Δ
or
p53

) generated only seven progeny from 3 litters, with no subsequent transmission of the deleted (recombined)
p53
allele. By P30 the mean total body weights (BW) and that of the eviscerated carcass of

Igf2
-dependent functional growth effects could be detected (
Fig 6B

Igf2

mice with ROSA 26 driven Cre (R26CreER

. Moreover, bi-allelic disruption of the
Igf2
allele eliminated the potential for tumour specific re-expression of the imprinted
Igf2
(silenced) maternal allele (LOI). Mice with conditional deletion of both alleles of
Igf2
and
p53
developed a longer tumour latency (
n
= 14, three lymphomas, four solid tumours, two unknown causes, no metastasis, median survival = 325 days) compared to mice with conditional deletion of
p53
but retention of the paternal
Igf2
allele (
n
= 19, 10 lymphomas, 1 solid tumour, 5 unknown causes, median survival = 206 days,
Fig 6C
). Importantly, the time-dependent onset of tumours mimicked that of the
p53

germ-line modification (Supporting Information

). There was a significant shift in tumour spectrum of

mice relative to
Igf2
Δ/Δ
,

mice with a reduction in lymphoma development relative to carcinoma and sarcoma (

). These results confirm that allelic dose of
Igf2
significantly reduced the onset of homozygote
p53
null tumour phenotype for all types of tumours.DISCUSSION
Single cell type
in vitro
models tend to lack tissue specific auto-regulatory feedback loops, and so, although informative, significance for
in vivo
function may be limited (Feng & Levine,
2010
). Here, we exploited the imprinting regulation of
Igf2
, a developmental and tumour growth factor, to both increase and decrease the allelic dosage of
Igf2
and ligand supply. An assumption was that genetic modifications altered
Igf2
expression alone. As in most mouse models, disruption of genomic regions can generate direct and indirect effects, with altered expression of microRNAs as an example. Loss of miR-675 in the
H19ncRNA
can promote tumour formation, as can an increase in miR-483 within the
Igf2
region (Gabory et al,
2009
; Veronese et al,
2010
; Yoshimizu et al,
2008
). A second assumption is that alteration of IGF2 ligand supply leads to physiological activation of the pathway. The proportionate growth effects of the
Igf2
models support this assumption when compared to un-physiological expression derived from introduced transgenes. The resulting increase in supply of IGF2 would bind cell surface IGF1R and IR-A, to activate downstream signalling to all intact pathway components, and specific feedback mechanisms (Ulanet et al,
2010
).
Igf2
-dependent developmental lethality and an
Igf2
-dependent modification of tumour formation occurred in
p53
null mice. When
Igf2
+m/−p
has been previously combined with genetic models of tumour susceptibility, including several developmental genes, there has been little evidence for combined lethality with this allele, suggesting that the synergistic lethality phenotype we now describe with
p53
is novel (Christofori et al,
1994
; Hassan & Howell,
2000
; Ho et al,
2009
; Wu et al,
2006
). Thus, our observation that homozygote null p53 mice fail to survive to adulthood in the context of disruption of the paternal allele of
Igf2
suggests
Igf2
is required to rescue a
p53
loss of function-dependent lethality.
The specific lethality in
Igf2
+m/−p
female progeny was genetically attributed to double heterozygote fathers. The paternal X-chromosome appears a prerequisite for lethality of the
Igf2
+m/−p
females because of the survival of male
Igf2
+m/−p
progeny. Female
Igf2
+m/−p
,
p53
+/−
progeny also survived, albeit at lower than expected numbers, indicating that loss of one allele of
p53
from the genotype of the offspring was sufficient for a partial rescue of the female specific lethality. We speculate that potential rescue mechanisms might include interactions of p53 with a range of epigenetic and X-specific targets, e.g. DNA methyltransferases (
Dnmt
; Park et al,
2005
; Peterson et al,
2003
) and
Xist
expression (Panning & Jaenisch,
1996
). In
Igf2
−m/−p
mice, the canalicular phase of lung maturation during late gestation appeared delayed, leading to lungs having poorly organized alveoli with thick septae and reduced airspaces (Silva et al,
2006
). Reduced exposure to maternal corticosteroids may have been responsible for the delayed lung development since progeny from
Igf2
−m/−p
mothers treated with this glucocorticoid had lung architecture similar to that of WT controls (Silva et al,
2006
). None of these effects were sex or female specific as in our case. Fibronectin (
Fn1
) is the major component of the extracellular matrix in the lung and excess supply promotes epithelial branching morphogenesis (Sakai et al,
2003
). The ten-fold increase in expression of
Fn1
in
Igf2
+m/−p
,
p53
+/+
female genotyped embryos destined to die, with lower levels in surviving
Igf2
+m/−p
,
p53
+/−
littermates, appeared significant, yet we could not reliably infer the phenotype was
Fn1
dependent. Expression of
Man1a2
gene, which encodes golgi α1,2-mannosidase IB, was also elevated in
Igf2
+m/−p
,
p53
+/+
female progeny. Homozygous knock-out of
Man1a2
produced a surprisingly severe lung phenotype that resulted in neonatal lethality (Tremblay et al,
2007
). Importantly,
Man1a2
−/−
mice died hours after birth from respiratory distress and alveolar haemorrhage, mirroring our phenotype even though in our case
Man1a2
appeared up-regulated (Tremblay et al,
2007
).
Deletion of the
H19
locus (Leighton et al,
1995
) is an imperfect model of LOI for
Igf2
. Importantly, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the effects that we observe may be due to removal of
H19
non-coding RNA, as been demonstrated in the small intestine (Yoshimizu et al,
2008
).
H19
long non-coding RNA has putative roles as a tumour suppressor (Yoshimizu et al,
2008
) and regulator of embryonic growth (Gabory et al,
2009
), mainly through loss of microRNA, miR-675, which is hosted by
H19
within its first exon (Cai & Cullen,
2007
; Mineno et al,
2006
). Thus the consequences of the 13 kb deletion in the
H19
−m/+p
model we utilized may also have had
Igf2
-independent gain of function effects on the p53 pathway. However, our previous analysis of miRNA profiles from these
Igf2
models revealed numerous other miRNA changes, despite
Igf2
specific phenotypic effects in the context of
Pten
heterozygosity (Church et al,
2011
).
The tumour-promoting effect of
H19
−m/+p
appeared independent of the direct loss of the WT p53 allele (LOH) in carcinoma and sarcoma tumours. We cannot however explain the female dependency of this phenotype, except to propose that it may depend on either the X chromosome, a strain modifier or via early hormonal changes (Harvey et al,
1993
; Jacks et al,
1994
). It has been observed that anti-tumour effects can occur following re-introduction of a WT
p53
allele in
p53
null tumours (Martins et al,
2006
; Ventura et al,
2007
; Xue et al,
2007
). Our data suggest that counteracting the inhibitory effects of the IGF2 pathway on the endogenous WT
p53
allele, may also lead to re-activation of the endogenous WT
p53
allele, and promote tumour suppression. In tumours with intact p53 alleles and
Igf2
over-expression, inhibiting the IGF2 signalling pathway may offer a therapeutic strategy. Conditional homozygous deletion of both
Igf2
and
p53
alleles slowed the development of tumours compared with the conditional deletion of
p53
alleles alone. Thus,
p53
loss of function in both development and tumour formation appears dependent on
Igf2.
The
Igf2
dependency of tumours that arise in the context of other models associated with p53 loss of function implicates
Igf2
as a significant factor that regulates the progression of tumours through regulation of apoptosis (Christofori et al,
1994
,
1995
; Lopez & Hanahan,
2002
), more recently observed in a mouse model of high grade chondrosarcoma (Ho et al,
2009
). In the chondrosarcoma model, a
p53
-dependent reduction of IGFBP levels may have accounted for a secondary increase in IGF2 ligand bio-availability, and hence dependence on
Igf2
. The dependency of tumour growth on the IGF pathway is further supported by observations in Li-Fraumeni associated tumours, as adrenal carcinoma and osteosarcoma have both been associated with dependency on IGF2, and are the basis of interventional clinical trials of agents that inhibit the activation of the IGF1 receptor (Avnet et al,
2009
; Barlaskar et al,
2009
). These data suggest that regulation of the IGF2 ligand in tumour susceptibility syndromes associated with
p53
(e.g. Li-Fraumeni, p53 and MDM2 associated SNPs) may be a potential strategy for tumour prevention. Finally, we cannot extend these observations to either gain of function mutants of
p53
, where partial, complete and altered pathway interactions may be evident (Hinkal et al,
2009
). These issues require further genetic investigation during development and tumour formation.MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and genotyping
Animal work was approved by University of Oxford ethics committee and UK Home Office. Mice [
Mus musculus
C57BL/6J (B6) and 129S2/J (129)] were maintained and genotyped as previously described (Hassan & Howell,
2000
; Supporting Information
Table S5
, primers available on request). The new
Igf2
conditional allele has loxp sites flanking exons 4–6 and was maintained (>10 generations) on a C57Bl6 background (Sandovici et al in preparation). Seminal plugs at 9.00 am and conception was taken ±12 h. Weighed embryos were fixed in either 4% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) or RNA
later
(Qiagen, Crawley, UK). DNA from E9.5 embryo yolk sacs was extracted by TRI reagent (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). To distinguish
Igf2
+m/−p
from
Igf2
−m/+p
, embryos with reduced CR length and low
Igf2
expression with qPCR were designated as being
Igf2
+m/−p
. Recombination of conditional alleles by R26CreER
+/−
was with Tamoxifen (1 mg, 5% v/v ethanol and 95% v/v corn-oil, Sigma, Poole, UK) injected I.P. at E10.5. Humane end-point for tumour burden was set at 18 months. Animals were checked daily for palpable tumours and evidence of systemic decline (weight loss, lack of grooming, reduced activity and piloerection).
The paper explained
PROBLEM:
The
p53
gene product is a transcription factor that controls the cells' response to genome toxins, such as radiation, and is a frequently mutated target in cancer. Inherited mutation of the
p53
gene can predispose humans to early onset cancers (Li-Fraumeni syndrome, LFS), and this effect can be reproduced in the mouse. When tumours form, the remaining wild-type (WT) allele is lost either through loss of genomic DNA in a process called ‘loss of heterozygosity (LOH)’, or by inhibition of p53. The pathways that modify the age of onset of LFS cancers are potential targets for screening and therapy, and such pathways may also be potential targets to restore function when p53 function is lost. Molecular interactions between p53 and a growth signalling pathway regulated by insulin-like growth factor (IGF) ligands have been observed in cell culture models. To date there has been no systematic analysis of the consequences of gain and loss of supply of the IGF2 ligand in the context of loss of p53 function in the whole organism.
RESULTS:
We addressed the problem by taking a comprehensive genetic approach in the mouse. We combined mice that lack supply of the IGF2 ligand (
Igf2
null) and mice with increased supply of
Igf2
(bi-allelic expressed alleles) with mice that were
p53
heterozygote and homozygote. If both these genes were homozygote null in all tissues, then embryonic development failed, suggesting an important pathway interaction. Interestingly, if the breeding male was heterozygote for both genes, only females with loss of the male derived
Igf2
allele developed a haemorrhagic lung syndrome, suggesting a more specific interaction. Importantly, the age of tumour onset was either reduced or increased if the supply of IGF2 was decreased and increased, respectively. When IGF2 supply was increased, we also observed that the WT p53 allele remained intact in an altered tumour spectrum towards carcinoma and sarcoma, suggesting the mechanism of suppression of p53 was independent of LOH in these tumours. Targeting IGF2 supply in this instance may reactivate the suppressed p53 and generate anti-tumour mechanisms.
IMPACT:
Screening patients with LFS can be a very effective method to detect early tumour formation and prevent development of lethal cancers. For some sporadic cancers, such as bone and soft tissue sarcoma that are frequently observed in LFS, defects in the p53 pathway have also been observed, suggesting that the sporadic development of p53-dependent cancers may in fact represent a spectrum of susceptibility ranging from germ-line mutation to pathway polymorphisms. To date, no therapeutic agents have been developed that modify the age of onset either in LFS tumours or in tumours (sarcoma) that arise in the context of p53 pathway modification rather than inherited gene mutation. Interruption of the IGF2 signaling pathway, for example by specific targeting of the ligand, may therefore be a useful mechanism to test the prevention of human tumours with a disrupted p53 pathway. Moreover, targeting IGF2 may be a treatment strategy in selected patients with tumours that arise in the context of p53 pathway disruption without LOH but with increased IGF2 pathway activity.
RNA extraction, reverse transcription and qPCR
Material stored at −80°C in RNA
later
(Applied Biosystems) were homogenized with either an Ultra-Turrax T8 (Ika Labortechnik, Staufen, Germany) or by a 25-gauge needle. A total nucleic acid isolation kit (Applied Biosystems) was used to extract RNA from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. RNA was quantified by NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK). RT-PCR (High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit, Applied Biosystems) prior to quantitative PCR normalized to the expression of β-actin (primer sequences available on request).
Immunohistochemistry and microscopy
Paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H & E; Hassan & Howell,
2000
). Antibodies and antigen retrieval methods are available on request. Sections were blocked (1 h, 1.5% v/v) with goat or rabbit serum, or overnight using a Mouse-on-Mouse kit (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK), and incubated with primary antibody either at 4°C (overnight) or at room temperature (RT, 1 h). Secondary labelling was with either biotinylated (Vectastain elite avidin–biotin complex kit, Vector Laboratories) or alexa-fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibodies and counterstained with haematoxylin or 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen). Digital images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Welwyn Garden City, UK) and a Nuance MSI camera (CRi, Woburn, MA) and analysed using Nuance 2.4.10 software. The percentage of Ki67 or cleaved-caspase 3 positive cells was scored by counting at least 500–1000 cells from 4 to 5 fields
per
tumour.
Microarray gene expression profiling and bioinformatics
RNA from E9.5 embryos were hybridized to Illumina Mouse Whole Genome 6 v1.1 or v2 BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego, CA) by Cambridge Genomic Services (Cambridge, UK) or Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics (Oxford, UK). Bioinformatics included R 2.12.0, (R Development Core Team, 2010) with microarray-specific packages obtained from the Bioconductor repository (Bioconductor 2.7, (Gentleman et al,
2004
). Raw data were normalized with ‘lumi’ (Du et al,
2008
) and Significance Analysis of Microarrays (Tusher et al,
2001
) with ‘siggenes’. Mapping of Illumina identifiers to annotation terms was done with ‘biomaRt’ and data from the Ensembl BioMart database (European Bioinformatics Institute, Cambridge, UK).
